","Symptoms Of Acidity
The symptoms of acidity occur when some of the acid content of the stomach flows back up into the esophagus or the food pipe, which connects the mouth to the stomach. Normally, a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) acts as a valve that lets food enter the stomach but does not allow it back up into the esophagus. When this valve fails to function properly, stomach contents are regurgitated into the esophagus and the following symptoms of acidity can be experienced:
 
1. Heartburn
Despite the name, heartburn has nothing to do with the heart. It is a common symptom of acidity that is caused when the excess stomach acid leaks out into the esophagus, leading to a burning sensation in the chest. This feeling can last for a few minutes to several hours. 
 
2. Regurgitation
Some people with acidity may experience regurgitation. It is a feeling in which the person may feel liquid undigested food, bile, or stomach acid moving up and down in the throat. This sensation is somewhat similar to the feeling of being pukish and usually occurs post meals, exercising, or bending right after eating.
 
3. Sour taste in the mouth
Another common symptom of stomach ailments, a sour taste in the mouth, is also a symptom of acidity. It happens when food, along with stomach acid and bile, rises up to the back of your throat, causing a bitter taste. This usually happens along with regurgitation.
 
4. Difficulty in swallowing
Difficulty in swallowing, also known as dysphagia, happens when excess acid in the stomach causes a feeling of fullness. It also causes a delay in the movement of food through the food pipe and impedes digestion.
 
5. Sore throat
When the stomach acid moves up to the mouth it can irritate the vocal cords or the voice box, leading to sore throat or hoarseness. 
 
6. Indigestion
Indigestion, also known as dyspepsia, can also be a key sign of acidity and other digestive problems. It can lead to a feeling of discomfort and a burning sensation in the upper middle part of the stomach. 
Heartburn is often confused as a symptom of heart attack. Read the article to know the difference bewteen angina, heartburn, and heart attack. Click Here","Causes Of Acidity
The stomach produces gastric acids that help in digesting food. However, due to some causes, there are times when gastric acids are produced in excess, leading to acidity. Factors affecting the function of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) are also responsible for acid reflux.
 
Some of the common causes of acidity include:
 
1. Food and dietary factors


Eating foods containing excessive amounts of chillies, pepper, vinegar, and paprika


Deep fried and oily foods


Excessive intake of caffeine in the form of tea, coffee, and chocolate


High intake of table salt


Diet low in fiber


Overeating or eating at irregular intervals


Unhealthy habits, like lying down just after eating


Eating just before strenuous physical exercise


 
2. Lifestyle factors


Frequent smoking


Excessive intake of alcohol, soda, or carbonated drinks


Lack of sleep


Lack of physical activity


 
3. Ailments and medications


Excessive stress, anxiety, or depression


Stomach diseases, like peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and stomach cancer


Medications, like painkillers, antibiotics, chemotherapy medications, and antidepressants 

","Risk Factors Of Acidity
The following conditions are related to increased risk of acidity:


Medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, celiac disease, and connective tissue disorders, like scleroderma


Hiatal hernia


Delayed stomach emptying


Overweight/Obesity


Pregnancy


Women who are nearing menopause


Women on hormone replacement therapy

","Diagnosis Of Acidity
If you experience any symptoms of acidity, such as burning pain or discomfort (also called heartburn), regurgitation or bloating or burping (with a sour taste in the mouth), then it is wise to consult a doctor. Your doctor might do some physical examination followed by a few questions related to your daily routine to know the cause of it.
 
If your symptoms are mild, your doctor might not recommend any tests. However, if your symptoms fail to show any improvement post-treatment or if you experience symptoms such as internal bleeding or difficulty in swallowing, then your doctor might recommend further investigation. The tests include:
1. Upper GI endoscopy: In this, a small flexible tube (known as endoscope) is inserted down the throat to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.
 
2. pH monitoring: This test helps measure stomach acid by checking how much stomach acid enters through the food pipe and how long it stays in the stomach. 
 
3. Barium swallow test (esophagram): In this, you need to drink a liquid barium mixture and get an X-ray of the chest and upper abdomen done to help identify any physical abnormalities in the stomach or esophagus.
 
4. Esophageal manometry: It is a test that helps check the function of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the muscles of the esophagus. It will tell your doctor if the food you eat can move through the esophagus normally or not. 
 
5. Electrocardiogram (ECG): In some cases ECG is also recommended if you report severe chest pain or discomfort to check your heart condition. Additionally, other tests, such as biopsy, can also be recommended based on your condition and the symptoms.
To get the right diagnosis, it is important to consult the right doctor. Consult India’s best doctors online. Click Here","Prevention Of Acidity
There are few simple tips and tricks that can help you to prevent and manage acidity. These include: 
1. Eat small, frequent meals
One of the simple tips to lower your risk of acid reflux is to eat small yet frequent meals. This is because overeating puts extra pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), a valve-like muscle which prevents the acid content in the stomach from entering the esophagus.
 
2. Eat a low-carb diet
A study has reported that a low-carb diet can improve heartburn symptoms, especially in obese individuals. It may be because excess carbohydrates can make you gassy and bloated, which in turn can lead to heartburn. 
 
3. Chew your food properly
When you eat slowly and chew your food properly, it provides sufficient time for the digestive juices to break down the food and digest it. This, in turn, can help you beat indigestion, acidity, and heartburn.
 
4. Avoid eating late at night
Unhealthy eating habits are one of the leading causes of digestion-related problems. Eating late at night because of work pressure or snacking heavily in the evening can, in turn, make you more prone to heartburn. Therefore, avoid this habit of late-night snacking or eating close to bedtime.
 
5. Limit consumption of spicy and deep-fried foods
Regular intake of highly spicy food can stimulate excessive gastric acid production. Similarly, deep-fried foods are slow to digest and trigger more acid production. Hence, these kinds of food should always be consumed in moderation.

6. Limit caffeine and carbonated beverages intake
One of the key ways to prevent heartburn is to avoid foods that trigger acid reflux. Caffeine-containing food and drinks, like tea or coffee, are highly acidic in nature and stimulate excessive gastric acid production. Likewise, carbonated beverages increase acidity because carbonation bubbles expand in the stomach and put pressure on the LES to open in the wrong direction and cause regurgitation of gastric acid.
 
7. Limit your alcohol intake
It goes without saying that drinking alcohol is bad for your health, especially, if you suffer from heartburn. Alcohol increases your risk of acid reflux and also worsens the condition. It irritates the lining of the stomach and impairs the ability of the LES to clear up acid. Hence, avoid alcohol to ease the symptoms of heartburn.
 
8. Quit smoking
Nicotine in cigarettes can relax the LES and trigger acidity. Hence, for the prevention of acidity and many other health benefits, it is always advisable to quit smoking.

9. Avoid strenuous physical activity right after eating
Strenuous physical activities like exercising or bending right after meals can hinder the process of digestion and can lead to a build-up of acid in the oesophagus. This can lead to acidity and worsen the condition if you already suffer from it. So give your stomach some time to empty its contents before you start exercising.
10. Do not sleep immediately after meals
It is important to maintain a gap of at least three hours between eating meals and hitting the sack. Lying down immediately after eating can increase the pressure on the LES which can make you vulnerable to acid reflux. Maintaining a gap can help the stomach to digest the food and prevent heartburn.
11. Raise the head of the bed
Elevating the head of the bed by about 15-20 cm can reduce symptoms of acidity and improve quality of sleep. This can be achieved by using a foam wedge to support the upper body. Stacking of pillows usually does not provide the uniform support one needs.
12. Try to lose weight
If you are overweight and suffer from acid reflux, then losing weight should be a priority. This is because excess fat, especially in the abdominal region, puts pressure on the stomach and the LES. This pushes the stomach acid upwards, which leads to acid reflux.

13. Check your medicines
Certain medicines can cause acid buildup or inflame the oesophagus, which can lead to heartburn or worsen the condition. Hence, talk to your doctor about the medicines you are recommended to be doubly sure of its side-effects such as heartburn.","Specialist To Visit
The symptoms of acidity are often easy to deal with by using over-the-counter medications and making lifestyle changes. However, if you experience severe chest pain or chest discomfort or heartburn that seems different or worse than usual, then consult a doctor. Also, if you experience these symptoms more than twice a week or on a regular basis, do not think twice before visiting your doctor’s clinic to know the exact cause and get it treated.

The medications used to treat heartburn work either by blocking the production  or aiding in the neutralization of the stomach acid. Based on their action mechanism, these drugs are classified into three main categories, namely: 
 
1. Antacids
Antacids, also known as stomach acid neutralizers, neutralize the stomach acid to provide quick relief from acidity. These are available in the form of tablets as well as syrups. Examples include:


Aluminum hydroxide


Magnesium hydroxide


Magnesium trisilicate


Magnesium carbonate


Calcium carbonate


The side effects of antacids are based on their ingredients. For example, antacids containing aluminum hydroxide might cause constipation as a side effect, whereas those containing magnesium hydroxide can lead to diarrhea. The long-term effects include gas (belching), swelling of the feet and hands, constipation, and diarrhea.
2. H2-receptor blockers 
These medications block specific receptors on the stomach cells that release gastric acids, thereby helping fight acidity. They are also known to aid in the treatment of damaged tissues in the stomach caused by peptic ulcers, gastritis, or stomach inflammation.
 
Some of the common side effects of drugs belonging to H2-receptor blockers class include abdominal pain and diarrhea. These drugs should not be taken by pregnant women as they can cause abortion and teratogenic (fetal defects) side effects. Examples include:


Famotidine


Ranitidine 


Nizatidine


 
3. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
PPIs block and reduce the production of stomach acid to relieve acidity. They are available both as over-the-counter and prescription drugs. These drugs are usually prescribed to people who do not show any improvement post diet and lifestyle changes or experience gastric symptoms regularly.
Side effects of these medications are rare but may include headache, diarrhea, and upset stomach. The long-term health effects of these medicines are not yet known, so talk to your doctor if you are taking PPIs for a long time or in high doses. Examples include:


Omeprazole


Pantoprazole


Rabeprazole


Esomeprazole


Lansoprazole


 
4. Coating drugs
Coating drugs, also known as ulcer protective drugs, protect the esophagus and stomach by forming a protective layer over the surface. These drugs are mostly recommended for short-term action and considered to be safe. They are mostly recommended for use in people suffering from stomach ulcers and peptic ulcer disease. Examples include:


Sucralfate


Carbenoxolone


Colloidal bismuth (CBS)


 
5. Prokinetic drugs
This class of drugs are prescription drugs and are known to act by promoting normal contraction of the esophagus and helping in the emptying of the stomach. These are commonly recommended for people with GERD and mostly in combination with medications that lower acid production in the body, such as PPIs and H2-receptor blockers. 
Some common side effects of these drugs include diarrhea, drowsiness, and agitation. Examples of drugs belonging to this class are:


Domperidone


Metoclopramide


Mosapride


Levosulpiride

","Home-care For Acidity
Diet plays a key role in managing and treating acidity. Here are some dos and don’ts you need to follow to keep your acid reflux under control and fight acidity.
Dos:


Eat foods rich in fiber, as fiber aids in the process of digestion.


Have small, frequent meals throughout the day to avoid excessive acid secretion.


Water is the best natural remedy for acidity. You must aim to consume close to 7-8 glasses (2-3 liters) of water every day.


Include foods such as oatmeal, ginger, salad, banana, melon, and fennel seeds in your daily diet.


Herbs, such as cardamom and mint, serve an immediate relief from acidity and associated pain.


 Don’ts :


Avoid excessive intake of oily and spicy foods.


Avoid excessive intake of caffeinated drinks, such as tea and coffee.


Say no to alcohol and carbonated beverages.


Do not overeat. It puts a direct load on the digestion process and causes the body to secrete acid in excess.

","Complications Of Acidity
Acid reflux or acidity usually does not cause any serious or long-term health problems when it occurs on an occasional basis. But if it happens frequently and is left unattended, it can lead to various stomach problems, such as:
 
1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): It is a condition in which the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is a ring of muscle between the esophagus (food pipe) and stomach, is affected. Acidity or heartburn is one of the most common symptoms of GERD.
 
2. Erosive esophagitis: As the name suggests, this condition is the inflammation in the esophagus, which may lead to ulcers as well as bleeding.
 
3. Ulcers: Acidity, if left untreated or unattended, can lead to stomach ulcers. This in turn can increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease.
 
4. Barrett’s esophagus: It is a condition in which the tissue that is similar to the lining of the intestine replaces the esophageal lining. In some cases, this condition can also increase the risk of esophageal cancer.
 
5. Esophageal stricture: In this condition, the esophagus becomes narrow, which leads to problems with swallowing.","Alternative Therapies Of Acidity
Home remedies for acidity
Here are a few quick fixes to control and get relief from acidity.1. Holy basil (Tulsi) leaves
Tulsi leaves have antiulcer properties that help in lowering the acid level in the stomach. They also stimulate the stomach to produce more mucus, thus neutralizing excess gastric acid in the stomach. Chew 4-5 leaves and swallow their juice to fight the burning sensation in the stomach and chest.
 
2. Cinnamon (Dalchini)
Cinnamon contains phytochemicals that help in the process of digestion, thus relieving acidity. Add a pinch of cinnamon powder to a teaspoonful of honey or water and consume it after meals to eliminate acidity.
 
3. Cumin seeds (Jeera)
Jeera seeds contain compounds which act as natural carminative and digestive agents and aid in relieving acidity caused due to indigestion and flatulence. Moreover, these seeds also help relieve the symptoms of acidity, such as stomach pain and discomfort. 
 
Add 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds to a cup of water, and let it boil till the water becomes slightly dark in color. Strain, cool, and sip this tea at regular intervals throughout the day if you experience frequent bouts of acidity.
 
4. Cold milk (Doodh)
Milk contains high amounts of calcium, a mineral which plays a key role in preventing acid buildup in the body, and hence, causes immediate relief. It also absorbs the excess acid produced in the stomach, thus nullifying its effect on the intestinal lining.
 
It is advised to drink cold (and not warm) milk to get rid of acidity. Remember to drink it plain, and avoid adding anything such as honey, sugar, and turmeric.
 
5. Buttermilk (Chaach)
Buttermilk neutralizes the excess acid in the stomach. It also contains lactic acid, which improves digestion and helps you fight acid reflux and gas trouble at home.
 
Drink a glass of buttermilk everyday after meals if you are prone to frequent acid attacks. You can also add a pinch of black pepper and coriander to it.
 
6. Carom seeds (Ajwain)
Ajwain contains a compound, thymol, that helps in secreting gastric juices, which in turn ease indigestion and gas.
 
Add a teaspoon of ajwain seeds or 3-4 fresh ajwain leaves to 2-3 glasses of water and boil. Strain it and drink this water regularly post meals/breakfast for quick relief.
 
Yoga for acidity

","Symptoms Of Acne

Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a recurrent skin condition. In this, the pores and hair follicles of the skin get clogged with sebum. Acne can be seen in the form of pimples, blackheads or comedones, or nodes of the skin. Following are the symptoms of acne:


Reddened and painful skin around the acne spots 


Skin that may become darker or scarred over time


Fever and joint pain may occur in rare but severe cases of acne 


Some symptoms based on the type of acne are:
 
1. Comedogenic acne (Non-inflammatory acne)


Closed comedones (whiteheads): These are small round lesions that contain whitish material (sebum and dead skin cells).


Open comedones (blackheads): These small round lesions appear as bumpy dark spots.


2. Non-comedogenic acne (Inflammatory acne) 


This acne appears as a red and painful area on the skin. 


They are small, reddish bumps that may or may not be filled with pus developed from comedones. 


Furthermore, this inflammatory acne can be presented in various forms. The most common ones include:


Papules: These are small painful bumps like eruptions on the skin.


Pustules: These pimples have pus collected in them and are red in color.


Nodules: These are large, painful, solid pimples that are deep in the skin.


Cysts: These deep, painful, pus-filled pimples can cause scars.


In some cases, a person may also suffer from a severe form of acne known as nodulocystic acne. In this, knots are formed on the skin that are hardened masses, larger than 5 mm, and usually present in the area of the back and neck.
","Causes Of Acne

The common causes of acne are: 
1. Hormonal conditions
Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, like PCOS and pregnancy, can also lead to acne breakouts. The menstrual cycle is one of the prime causes of hormonal acne seen in women. 
 
2. Genetic factors
The genes may be somewhat responsible for the development, course, and severity of acne. Although acne is not the result of a single gene but a series of different genes.
 
3. Environmental factors
Environmental factors, such as sunlight, can worsen acne, along with skin aging. Also, climatic conditions, such as humid weather, can aggravate acne problems in certain individuals due to the overstimulation of sebaceous glands.
 
4. Lifestyle factors
Certain food products, such as dairy, products made from dairy, and sugary foods, can cause acne. Also, stress and increased weight are two major causes of acne in many individuals. 
 
5. Health conditions
Certain metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, may cause acne in some individuals. Also, the use of some medications, such as lithium, corticosteroids, or testosterone-containing tablets and creams can result in acne.  
 
6. Chemicals/products
The application of perfumed products, such as cosmetics, hair products, and soaps, can result in acne in some individuals. Irritation of the affected skin area by either scratching, pulling, pressing, or wearing tight garments, such as headbands or scarves around the face and neck, can also cause acne.

Acne, when ignored for a long, can become severe and ultimately lead to scar formation. Some common complications include:
 
1. Scars: Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain for a long time after the acne has healed. Scars left by acne can affect both teenagers and adults. Scars are a result of acne breakouts, penetrating deep into the skin layers. The longer someone has inflammatory acne, the higher it is likely to develop acne scars. Therefore, it is best to seek timely treatment for this condition and prevent the formation of acne scars. 
2. Skin changes: After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before.
3. Emotional well-being: Acne can affect more than just skin. It can have a significant impact on one’s emotional well-being. According to studies, acne can lead to low self-esteem, poor self-image, anxiety, depression, decreased quality of life, and feeling alone. Moreover, severe and chronic acne can also take a toll on confidence.","Alternative Therapies For Acne
Ayurveda
Ayurvedic science believes that acne results from the ventilation of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas in the body. Here is a list of some herbs that can help heal acne faster.
 
Turmeric (Haldi): Turmeric has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal effects, which can help relieve acne problems. Apply a thin paste of turmeric over the affected area after consulting a doctor. 
 
Honey (Sahed) and Lemon (Nimbu): Honey and lemon have antibacterial properties that could help in healing the acne. However, be careful before applying lemon directly to the face as it may irritate the skin. 
 
Neem leaves: Neem offers anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. It works well against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and hinders the growth of acne-causing bacteria, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Ground fresh or dried neem leaves into a soft paste by adding water and apply it on the face. Wash it off after 10-15 minutes with warm water.

Medications, therapies, and treatments can give long-lasting results; however, it is important to take care of your skin at home too. Below mentioned are some tips to follow at home if you have acne:
Be gentle with your skin: Use a mild cleanser in the morning and evening. Avoid scrubbing your skin as it can worsen your acne.
Avoid certain products: Products such as facial scrubs, astringents, and masks tend to irritate the skin, especially sensitive skin, which can worsen acne. Excessive washing and scrubbing can also irritate the skin.
Refrain from touching your skin too often: People who squeeze, pinch, or pick their pimples can get scars or dark spots on their skin.
Shave carefully: Men and women both can use this tip while shaving facial hair. Men should soften their beards with some soap and water before applying the shaving cream, and the same applies to women too. Facial hairs are delicate and pre-softening is required before shaving. Shave lightly and only when you have to.
Avoid over-exposure to the sun: Many acne medications can make the skin prone to sunburn. Consult a doctor to know more about the reaction of the cream to sun rays.
Choose your makeup carefully: Use oil-free makeup. Look for the word “non-comedogenic” on the label. A ‘non-comedogenic’ label means that the product will not clog up the pores.
Use medications wisely: If the doctor has recommended any treatment plan for acne, it is important to give the treatment some time to show effective results. If acne treatment works, some improvements might be noticed within 4 to 6 weeks. It might take more than 3 months for the skin to clear up.
Avoid using different products all at once: Do not use a new acne product every week as this can irritate the skin and cause fresh breakouts, making it difficult to treat the condition.

Tiredness and fatigue


Loss of appetite


Craving for salt


Nausea, vomiting


Abdominal pain


Dizziness


Pain in the muscles


Diarrhea


Loss of consciousness


Constipation 


Increased pigmentation


Loss of weight


Hypotension (low BP)


Anemia


Vitiligo (a disease that causes loss of skin color in patches)



Note: Sometimes the symptoms of Addison's disease appear suddenly. This is known as the Addisonian crisis. It is a life-threatening situation that results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar, and high blood levels of potassium. ","Causes Of Addison's Disease

Addison's disease is caused by damage to the adrenal glands that sit just above the kidneys resulting in adrenal insufficiency. Causes of adrenal insufficiency based on the type includes:
Primary adrenal insufficiency
It occurs when the adrenal glands are damaged and don’t make enough of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. The major causes of primary adrenal insufficiency include:
Autoimmune disorders: These are conditions in which your immune system attacks your adrenal glands. These include:


Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (an inherited condition affecting major organs)


Candidiasis


Ectodermal dysplasia ( a genetic disorder affecting the development of the teeth, hair, nails, and sweat glands)


Autoimmune thyroiditis 


Type 1 diabetes 


Pernicious anemia


Vitiligo or alopecia



Infections: These can cause an adrenal crisis due to decreased cortisol leading to severe complications. Infections that can cause primary adrenal insufficiency include:


Sepsis


Tuberculosis


HIV


Cytomegalovirus infections


Fungal infections


Syphilis


Adrenal hemorrhage: Bilateral adrenal hemorrhages can be due to DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation, a serious disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become overactive), trauma, meningococcemia (infection in the bloodstream). 

Note: An Adrenal crisis due to meningococcemia is known as the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome and is more common in children and patients without a spleen.



Infiltration: This can be due to cancer and abnormal growths (tumors) that can cause primary adrenal insufficiency.





Drugs: Certain drugs can cause adrenal insufficiency by blocking cortisol synthesis. They include:


Blood thinners


Glucocorticoids


Antifungal agents


Secondary adrenal insufficiency
This starts when the pituitary gland doesn’t make enough of the hormone ACTH (adrenocorticotropin) resulting in decreased cortisol levels. Causes of secondary adrenal insufficiency include:


Tumors


Medications like corticosteroids


Family history

Adrenal insufficiency causes Addison’s disease. There are certain factors that can increase your chances of developing this insufficiency. They include:
1. Type I diabetes
The risk of developing Addison’s disease is higher in those suffering from type 1 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes also known as juvenile diabetes is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin.

Note: Type I Diabetes is called Juvenile diabetes because it affects the younger population. It is an autoimmune condition causing the destruction of the cells of the pancreas.

2. Hypoparathyroidism
It is a condition in which the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone. Though a rare disorder, affected individuals have been associated with Addison's disease.
3. Hypopituitarism
Your pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of your brain. It produces and releases several hormones that help carry out important bodily functions. Hypopituitarism leads to a deficiency of one or more of the pituitary hormones and can lead to adrenal insufficiencies.
4. Pernicious anemia
Pernicious anemia is caused by Vitamin B12 deficiency and is associated with primary adrenal insufficiency.
5. Testicular dysfunction
It is a condition in which the testicles cannot produce enough sperm or male hormones, such as testosterone. This can be caused by autoimmunity, which in turn increases the chances of getting Addison’s disease.
6. Grave’s disease
It is an immune system disorder that results in the overproduction of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism). Grave’s disease and Addison's disease are linked with a strong auto-immune basis.
Note: Individuals with Graves' disease and Addison's simultaneously are at risk of incipient adrenal crisis.
7. Chronic thyroiditis
It is a condition that causes swelling of the thyroid gland. It often results in reduced thyroid function, thus increasing the risk for the development of Addison’s disease.
8. Dermatitis herpetiformis
Commonly known as celiac disease, this is a chronic condition with intense itching, and blisters all over the skin. Individuals with this disorder are at a higher risk of developing Addison’s disease and other autoimmune conditions.
9. Vitiligo
Sporadic vitiligo is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, and lupus.

10. Myasthenia gravis
It is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies destroy the communication between nerves and muscles, resulting in weakness of the skeletal muscles. This condition is rarely associated with Addison’s disease.
11. Medications 
Certain drugs like Ketoconazole and Etomidate can cause adrenal insufficiency by blocking cortisol synthesis. 
12. Other risk factors


Sarcoidosis: It is characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells, (known as granulomas) in the body.


Lymphoma: Cancer of the lymphatic system that includes lymph nodes, spleen, thymus gland, and bone marrow.


Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: A group of genetic disorders affecting the adrenal gland.


Adrenoleukodystrophy: It is a type of genetic condition that damages the membrane protecting the nerve cells in the brain.

Timely treatment of Addison’s disease is very crucial, as negligence can lead to an Addisonian crisis that can be life-threatening. The treatment mainly consists of hormone replacement therapy that corrects the levels of steroid hormones. It includes:

1. Hormone replacement therapy


Glucocorticoid replacement: The medications commonly used are:

Hydrocortisone

Prednisone 
Dexamethasone

 During this regime, clinical symptoms and plasma ACTH are monitored as required. 


Mineralocorticoid replacement: Fludrocortisone is the most commonly used drug during this regime. During this treatment, it is important to monitor blood pressure as well as pulse, edema, and serum potassium levels




Androgen replacement: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is usually the drug of choice. This therapy is given only in women for psychological well-being, if needed, after optimal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement

2. Management of adrenal crisis
This is a life-threatening condition that needs immediate treatment. The management consists of the following:


Intravenous (IV) infusion of isotonic saline or 5% dextrose as early as possible


Analysis of serum electrolytes, glucose, and routine measurement of plasma cortisol and ACTH.


IV Hydrocortisone and due correction of any ongoing electrolyte abnormalities


3. Treatment during pregnancy
Pregnant patients with primary adrenal insufficiency should be monitored for clinical symptoms and signs of glucocorticoid over- and under-replacement (normal weight
gain, fatigue, low or high BP, increased blood sugar) with at least one review per trimester. The drugs used are:


Hydrocortisone


Prednisolone


Dexamethasone


4. Treatment during childhood
In children with primary adrenal insufficiency, treatment with hydrocortisone in three or four divided doses is recommended. Fludrocortisone is recommended in children with primary adrenal insufficiency along with aldosterone (a hormone that helps regulate your blood pressure) deficiency.","Complications Of Addison's Disease

The major complication of Addison’s disease is acute adrenal insufficiency or Addisonian crisis. This generally occurs when your body is stressed mainly due to an illness, fever, surgery, or dehydration. If an Addisonian crisis is not treated, it can lead to the following complications:



Shock


Seizures


Severe abdominal pain


Extreme weakness


Low blood pressure


Kidney failure


Coma

Certain alternative therapies have shown good results in managing Addison's disease along with conventional treatment. These include:
Naturotherapy
This is a method to treat illnesses or conditions using natural foods, massages, and other techniques instead of artificial medications. The most commonly used herb is Ashwagandha, which helps to restore optimal health by maintaining energy levels and immunity function. 
Salt substitution therapy
Salt substitutes replace part of the sodium chloride in regular salt with potassium chloride. This therapy can maintain the expected level of sodium chloride and other elements found to be deficient in these individuals.
Regenerative therapy
This therapy is beneficial for Addison’s disease as it uses the application of stem cells. Stem cells are cells from which all other cells with specialized functions are generated. They have the potential to repair and restore function in damaged body tissues or organs. ","Living With Addison's Disease
Diagnosis of Addison’s disease may come as a shock and the fact that it requires lifelong treatment can be overwhelming. But, this condition can be well managed and individuals with this disorder can live their life to the fullest. However, there are certain things to remember if you have Addioson’s disease. These include:
1. Understand your condition
Knowing everything about your illness can be very beneficial, especially in managing an emergency situation.
Also, managing stress and learning to inject your medications can help you be independent.
2. Have a medical alert bracelet/necklace
It is an emergency medical information card on your phone or inside your wallet, and prefilled syringes containing 4 mg of dexamethasone in 1 mL saline. An emergency card and medical alert identification helps emergency care providers know what kind of care you might need. 
3. Keep extra medicines handy
Missing out on even a single dose can be dangerous, so always keep your medications stocked up. Also, have a small supply at work and with you when you travel. 
4. Get yearly checkups
See your doctor at least once a year. Your doctor may recommend yearly screening for autoimmune diseases, and monitoring your hormone levels. If you have problems with your medication, your provider might need to change the doses or time.

","Symptoms Of Airplane Ear
 
The typical symptoms of airplane ear include:

Discomfort in the ear/s
Pain in the ear/s
Fullness in the ear/s
Mild to moderate hearing loss

In severe cases, an individual may experience:

Severe pain in the ear/s
Moderate to severe hearing loss
Tinnitus (ringing sound in the ear)
Vertigo
Hemotympanum (presence of blood in the middle air cavity)
","Causes Of Airplane Ear
 
To understand the cause of airplane ear, it is important to know the normal structure of the ear and how the ear works at ground level
Structure of the ear
The structure of the ear is divided into three parts:
Outer ear: The part of the ear that is seen from the outside is the outer ear. The external auditory canal connects it to the middle ear. There is a separation between the middle ear and outer ear with a structure called the eardrum.
Middle ear: A tube-like structure called the eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the nose. It plays a very important role in maintaining air pressure on either side of the eardrum.
Inner ear: The inner ear has several compartments that perform specific functions for the purpose of hearing and maintaining balance.
How does the ear work when we are at ground level?
At normal level, the pressure of the air is the same in the middle ear cavity and external ear canal. This equalization of pressure helps in normal functioning of the ear. 
What happens to the ears when we are in the flight?

During take-offs and landings, the air pressure inside the middle ear reduces rapidly compared to the external cabin air pressure
Due to this pressure difference, eardrum is pulled inside
The eustachian tube is not able to react fast enough and gets flattened.
This stretching of the eardrum and eustachian tube lead to the symptoms of ear barotrauma.


Other conditions that can cause ear barotrauma include:

Scuba diving without proper gear
Exposure to loud explosions, like in and around a war zone
Hyperbaric oxygen chambers
Riding in an elevator in a tall building 
Driving in the mountains

Why doesn't everyone on the flight experience the same degree of an airplane ear?
Not everyone suffers from the same intensity of symptoms of airplane ear while flying. This is due to the differences in opening and closing of the eustachian tube. In most of cases, the eustachian tube opens periodically during swallowing, yawning and chewing and tries to maintain equal pressure between the outside and inside of the ear.
However, people with a narrow eustachian tube or any blockages associated with cold, throat infections etc are more prone to develop airplane ear or ear barotrauma. ",,"Diagnosis Of Airplane Ear
 
The diagnosis of airplane ear is confirmed based on air travel history and symptoms experienced by the patient. In case of uncertainty about the symptoms, confirmation is done through:
Otoscopy
This involves examination of the inner ear through an instrument called an otoscope. The signs that are looked at with an otoscope involves:

Bulging in the eardrum
Tear in the eardrum
Blood/fluid in the eardrum 

Audiometry
This test is performed when a person complains of loss of hearing. ","Prevention Of Airplane Ear
 
Airplane ear is a preventable condition. The prevention strategies can be divided into three categories:
A. Primary prevention
It involves measures that can be taken before or during any discomfort in the ears. 
1. Practice self-care measures: The activities such as yawning, chewing, and swallowing especially during take off and landing should be performed during flying. These activities help in keeping the eustachian tubes open and thus prevent airplane ear. 
Sucking lozenges and chewing gum while the plane begins to ascend and descend is also helpful. 2. Stay awake: Individuals should avoid sleeping or napping during ascent and descent of flights so that they can practice activities such as yawning, chewing, and swallowing. Individuals can also request the attendees of the flight to wake them up when the plane is about to land. 3. Use of air pressure regulating earplugs: There are specialized ear plugs that are often sold at airports, pharmacies, or a hearing clinic. They are helpful in equalizing pressure against the eardrum and thus help in preventing airplane ear. 4. Take medications: Individuals suffering from cold can prevent airplane air by taking decongestants an hour before the take off of the flight.Note: It is important to take consent from your healthcare provider before taking a decongestant in case of high blood pressure, a heart ailment, a heart rhythm disorder or pregnancy.5. Use over-the-counter (OTC) nasal sprays: Nasal congestion increases the chances of airplane ear. So, it is recommended to use a nasal spray about 30 minutes before take-off. 6. Blow a special autoinflation balloon: These special balloons have to be blown up through the nose, by blocking off one nostril at a time and blowing through the other. These can be bought from pharmacies, and help people manage pain during flying or unblock ears afterwards.7. Reschedule air travel plans: If possible, try to reschedule the travel plans by air if you are suffering from common cold, sinusitis, nasal congestion, recent ear surgery or infection, particularly if you have experienced considerable airplane ear symptoms during prior air travel.
B. Secondary prevention
It involves strategies to prevent severe ear pain in case of ear discomfort. 
1. Valsalva manoeuvre: It is an activity that is performed by passengers feeling ear discomfort during the flight. The technique helps in equalizing pressure in the middle ear and thus help in preventing airplane ear. It involves the following steps:

Take a breath.
Push that breath out against the closed mouth and nose
Hold for 15 to 20 seconds.
Open the nose and mouth
Breathe out. 

2. Ear packing
In case of bleeding, immediate ear packing should be done to prevent further damage.
C. Tertiary prevention
It involves long-term preventive techniques. A tube is placed surgically in the eardrums to help in the fluid drainage and equalize the pressure between the outer and middle ear. It is used for frequent fliers who are prone to severe airplane ear. 
Special tips to prevent airplane ear in infants and toddlers
Infants and toddlers are more prone to airplane ears due to small eustachian tube. 
As a parent or guardian with whom kids are flying, the following measures may help minimize symptoms of airplane ear:

Breastfeeding
Feeding with a bottle 
Sucking a pacifier
Drinking fluids through a sipper or a straw 


Children more than 4 years of age can try the following:

Chewing gum
Drinking fluids through a straw 
Blowing bubbles through a straw


Note: Decongestants are usually not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Always consult the child’s pediatrician before giving them to the child.","Treatment Of Airplane Ear

Preventive instructions should also be given by airplane authority about this phenomenon. This will help in spreading awareness and combating the condition. Airplane ear is managed by simple techniques. 

Yawning or swallowing is recommended as it opens the eustachian tube and reduces the pressure difference. This helps in easing the symptoms. 
In case of prolonged cold or allergies medications such as antihistamines (egs. cetirizine, fexofenadine,loratadine)  and decongestants (egs.oxymetazoline, phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine) can be taken.
In case of severe pain, pain relief medications such as paracetamol can be taken.
A minor surgery known as myringotomy is performed in rare cases. In this, a surgical cut is made in the eardrum to drain accumulated fluids and allow equalization of pressure.
","Complications Of Airplane Ear

The symptoms of airplane ear are mostly self-limiting responds well to preventive measures and usually does not pose any complications. In very rare instances, when eardrum is put under so much pressure that it bursts, it can lead to:


Acute ear infections
Hearing loss
Chronic tinnitus (ringing in ears)
Vertigo
Perforation in the eardrum

","Causes Of Allergy
Allergies are caused when the body’s immune system responds abnormally to an external trigger known as ‘allergen’, which does not usually incite an immune response in most other human beings. When the allergen comes in contact with the human body, the immune system activates a response system by producing IgE antibodies. Usually, this immune response is not harmful, but an extreme reaction of the immune system may lead to the formation of a chemical called histamine that causes the various symptoms of allergy.There are innumerable substances that can cause allergies. The most commonly observed allergens are:

Dust
Mold
Mites
Pollen
Animal fur
Insect bites
Latex
Foods like peanuts, shellfish, and milk
Certain medications like penicillin, and NSAIDs
Seasonal changes
","Symptoms Of Allergy

There are many different types of allergies, each of them present with different symptoms, such as1. Skin allergy: Also known as ‘atopic dermatitis’ or eczema, it can cause symptoms like:

Redness, itchiness, and pain in the parts of the skin exposed to the allergen. 
It may also cause the skin to become flaky and peel off.


2. Allergic conjunctivitis: When an allergen enters the eye and irritates the conjunctival lining, it may cause the following symptoms:

Redness in the eyes
Puffy eyes
Excessive watering of the eyes
Itching or burning sensation of the eyes
Changes in vision


3. Food allergy: Consuming foods that cause allergy can cause symptoms such as:

Tingling in the mouth 
Puffing of the face 
Swelling of the lips 
Swelling of the tongue 
Difficulty breathing 
Itching all over the body
In severe cases, it can cause anaphylaxis



4. Insect allergy: An insect sting can cause allergic symptoms like:

Pain, swelling, and redness at the site 
Itching all over the body 
Difficulty breathing 
Chest tightness and wheezing
In severe cases, it can also cause anaphylaxis


5. Respiratory allergy: Allergic rhinitis and asthma are types of respiratory allergies. Symptoms of respiratory allergies are:

Shortness of breath 
Coughing 
Wheezing 
Chest tightness 
Runny nose


6. Medicinal allergy: Certain medications can trigger an allergic reaction and cause symptoms like:

Swelling of the face and body 
Difficulty breathing 
Cough 
Chest tightness 
Skin rash 
Skin itching
Anaphylaxis, in severe cases

7. Anaphylaxis: This is a severe reaction to any type of allergy, which can be life-threatening. The symptoms of anaphylaxis are:

Anaphylactic shock
Severe drop in blood pressure
Loss of consciousness
Extreme difficulty while breathing
Weak and thready pulse
Nausea
Skin rash
",,,"Prevention Of Allergy
Allergies by themselves cannot be prevented as they are mostly hereditary. But the harmful effects that occur due to allergy, otherwise known as an allergic reaction, can be prevented. The single most effective way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid exposure to the causative allergen.It is important first to understand and recognize the trigger that causes the allergic reaction. Once the agent is identified, all steps must be taken to avoid exposure to the allergen, wherever possible. For example: 


Dust allergy: Using face masks or tying a wet cloth over the nose and mouth while cleaning or dusting an area with excessive dust.


Food allergy: Avoiding foods that may cause allergies, even in minute quantities.


Medicine allergy: Always inform your doctor if you have had an allergic reaction to any medicine in the past so that the doctor can modify the treatment accordingly.


Mold allergy: Molds usually grow in dark enclosed places, devoid of sunlight. To prevent exposure to molds, all areas at home must be adequately ventilated and receive plenty of natural sunlight.


Those who face respiratory problems on and off can benefit by using some natural herbs on a regular basis or as advised. Here are a few natural herbs that will help you fight symptoms of common respiratory allergies.Here's More To Read!","Specialist To Visit

The treatment for an allergic reaction aims to provide symptom relief and long-term management for desensitization of the immune system.
1] Symptomatic relief
1. Antihistamines: These are used to provide relief from allergic reaction symptoms such as itching, swelling, and rashes. They work by blocking the action of histamine, the chemical responsible for allergy symptoms. They may be given orally or applied topically on the skin in a lotion or cream form to provide relief from skin rash and itching. Antihistamine eye drops are used to provide relief from eye allergies. Antihistamines can also be administered through the nose to provide rapid relief from nasal congestion, sneezing, runny nose, and other respiratory symptoms. Medicines that belong to this class include:

Levocetirizine
Chlorpheniramine Maleate

Loratadine 


2. Nasal decongestants: These can also provide symptom relief by reducing nasal congestion and make breathing easier. These include:

Xylometazoline
Oxymetazoline

3. Corticosteroids: These are available for oral consumption or in an injectable form. They are used to provide rapid relief from mild to severe allergy symptoms such as inflammation and rash. Steroids may also be prescribed as eye drops to help with eye symptoms and skin rashes. Examples of this class of medicine include:

Prednisolone
Hydrocortisone
Betamethasone
Dexamethasone

.
4. Bronchodilators: These are used to provide relief from acute asthma symptoms. Other medicines for inhalation are prescribed as daily maintenance therapy for asthma. Salbutamol is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines in this category.
2] Immunotherapy
For severe allergies or allergies that do not respond to standard medication, immunotherapy may be tried. This involves a series of allergen exposures via injections or tablets over a period of a few years. With time, this helps desensitize the body’s immune system to the allergen and prevents serious allergic reactions.
3] Treatment for anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is the most severe form of an allergic reaction that requires immediate medical care. When a patient starts getting an anaphylactic attack, they must be given an injection of adrenaline as soon as possible, and it may need to be repeated at intervals. Symptoms of anaphylactic attack may include dizziness, difficulty in breathing, skin rashes, nausea or vomiting, and fast heart rate. The patient must receive prompt supportive care at the hospital.

","Symptoms Of Baby Colic 

It’s normal for babies to fuss and cry. Babies who have colic tend to cry more than other babies, even though they’re otherwise healthy. Features of colic can include:



Intense and incessant crying episodes (lasting for usually more than 3 hours) even in the absence of triggers like hunger or need of diaper change.


Crying at the same time(s) everyday. Colicky babies mostly get fussy towards the end of the day. However, crying can happen at any time.


Clenching their fists, raising their legs above and tightening their abdominal muscles while crying.


Crying is loud, piercing and ceaseless in nature like they’re in pain. 


Turning bright red when crying.


An increase in bowel activity may also be observed. They may break wind (pass gas) or spit up.



Worried that your baby may have infantile colic? Not sure if It's Colic or Normal Crying? Read this article to assess the symptoms.
Read Here","Causes Of Baby Colic
Colic usually starts in the second or third week of life, peaks around 6 weeks, and resolves by the age of 12 weeks in 60%  and by 16 weeks of age in 90% of infants.
The exact cause of colic is not fully understood, but there are several factors that are believed to contribute or trigger to this condition:

1. Digestive issues in the infant


Intolerance to lactose or cow's milk protein


Sensitivity to food in the breastfeeding mother's diet


Excessive gassiness or gas production


An immature digestive system


Acid reflux


Swallowing air


Overfeeding or underfeeding


Insufficient burping



2. Exposure to medications through breast feeding 


Caffeine and nicotine in breast milk have been related to infant irritability because the baby's body is unable to adequately eliminate these toxins.


Certain medications are also passed through breast milk. If you are breastfeeding, discuss your medications with your doctor.



3. Neurodevelopmental issues


Higher level of serotonin (a key hormone that can stabilize mood)


An immature nervous system


Infant temperament 


An early form of childhood migraine



4. Others


Interruption in sleeping pattern


Sensitivity to light, noise, etc., or too much stimulation


Poor feeding techniques


Emotions such as fear, frustration, or even excitement


Underlying health issues like hernia or infection etc.

","Risk Factors For Baby Colic
 
There are several risk factors that may contribute to the development of colic. These include:

1. Age: Colic typically begins within the first few weeks of life and peaks around 6 to 8 weeks of age. After this time, symptoms often start to improve.

2. Sleeping pattern: As per some studies, babies who have irregular sleeping patterns or who do not get enough sleep may be more prone to colic.

3. Family history: Babies who have a family history of colic or other digestive problems may be more likely to develop colic themselves.

4. Parental emotional factors: Babies who are exposed to high levels of stress or anxiety may be more likely to develop colic.

Here are some age-old practices that can help reduce stress and anxiety.Read Here","Diagnosis Of Colic

To diagnose colic in infants, doctors typically rely on a set of criteria known as the ""Rule of Three."" These are some of the criteria-



Symptoms persist for more than 3 hours a day


Happens more than 3 days a week


Persisting for more than 3 weeks



If an infant meets these criteria, a doctor may diagnose them with colic. However, before making a diagnosis, the pediatrician will do a physical exam and review your baby’s history and symptoms. 
The doctor might perform some tests to rule out other medical conditions that can cause similar symptoms.","Doctor To Visit

Colic is usually not the cause of concern. You should, however, consult your baby’s pediatrician immediately if your baby’s colic is combined with one or more of the following symptoms:



Fever of over 100.4˚F (38˚C)


Vomiting, diarrhea


Bloody or mucus in stools


Pale skin


Crying a lot


Not sucking or drinking a bottle well


Drinking less milk than usual


Becoming more irritable when held or touched

While colic can be distressing for both the infant and the parents, the following tips can help you make it more manageable. 
1. General tips

Warm bath: A warm bath can help calm an infant's digestive tract and relieve colic. Fill a bathtub halfway with warm water and gently massage your baby's abdomen.
Massage: Massage might also assist to alleviate colic symptoms. Massage your baby's tummy in a gentle, circular motion, beginning at the navel and progressing outward.
Paddling exercise: Bicycling a baby’s legs can help him to pass gas. Lay your baby in a supine position, hold their ankle very gently and start pressing one leg towards their tummy. Hold every time you press their ankle for a few seconds and then release. 
Kangaroo Care: It is a method of care for preterm infants. The method involves infants being carried, usually by the mother, with skin-to-skin contact. It helps calm and soothe a baby.
Keep a routine: Establishing a routine can help your baby feel more secure and may help reduce their colic symptoms. Try to stick to a consistent feeding, sleeping, and playtime schedule.
Feed: Try to feed your baby before they become overly hungry or distressed. Overfeeding can exacerbate colic symptoms. 
Experiment with feeding: If you're breastfeeding, try adjusting your diet to see if it affects your baby's colic symptoms. If you're formula-feeding, talk to your pediatrician about trying different types of formula.
Try a pacifier: Sucking on a pacifier can help soothe and calm a fussy baby. However, make sure to use a pacifier only after breastfeeding to avoid nipple confusion.Explore a variety of baby pacifiers on our website.Add to cart

 

Soothe your baby: Try different soothing techniques to help your baby feel more comfortable, such as gentle rocking, swaying, or carrying them in a baby carrier. 
Pleasant sounds: Try using something in your child's room that makes a soothing sound, such as a fan, or a heartbeat CD. It may also calm a fussy baby and promote sleep.
Check for medical issues: Colic can sometimes be a sign of an underlying medical issue, so it's important to have your baby evaluated by a pediatrician to rule out any problems.
Take a break for yourself : Caring for a colicky baby can be exhausting, so make sure to take breaks whenever you can. Ask for help from friends or family members, or consider hiring a babysitter or nanny for a few hours to give you a break.

 ","Causes Of Back Pain
The human back comprises many parts, including muscles, ligaments, tendons, discs, and bones, all of which work together to support the body and allow it to move. Disks are cartilage-like pads that support the spine fragments. Issues with any of these components can cause back pain.
1. Strain
Excessive strain or trauma can cause damage to the back. For example, improperly lifting something or lifting something too heavy. Other causes that can strain the back include:

Poor posture
Excessive exercise
Prolonged sitting and lying down
Sleeping in an uncomfortable position
Obesity
Pregnancy
Muscle or ligament strain
Spasm of a muscle
Muscle tenseness
Damages disks 
Falls or fractures

Understand more about causes of obesity, that you need to be aware of.Tap Now!
2. Structural problems 
A variety of structural issues can also cause back pain. They include:


Ruptured discs: Each vertebra is cushioned by discs. If the disc ruptures, there will be increased pressure on a nerve, resulting in back pain.


Bulging discs: A bulging disc can put more pressure on a nerve, causing back pain.


Sciatica: It is a sharp and shooting pain usually caused by a bone spur or herniated disc pressing on the nerve and radiating through the buttock, down the back of the leg along the sciatica nerve.


Arthritis: It can cause pain in the lower back, joints of the hips, and other areas.


Scoliosis: It is a condition in which the spine curves to the side resulting in back pain. 


Osteoporosis: Brittle and porous bones, including those of vertebrae of the spine, can cause compression fractures resulting in back pain.

3. Inflammation
Inflammation can cause back pain localized to the axial spine (lower back) and sacroiliac joints (situated where the lower spine and pelvis connect). It is usually chronic in nature. Conditions that can cause this include:  


Ankylosing spondylitis: It is an inflammatory disease that, over time, can cause some of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) to fuse. 


Sacroiliitis: It is an inflammation of one or both of the sacroiliac joints. Sacroiliitis can cause pain in the lower back or buttocks and can extend down one or both legs.


Tuberculous spondylitis: Also known as Pott disease, it is a rare disease associated with the gradual onset of progressive back pain.


4. Tumors
Patients experience intense back pain in malignancies (cancer) that have metastasized (spread) to the spine like:


Lung cancer


Stomach cancer


Breast cancer


Prostate cancer


Certain tumors in the spinal cord like:


Multiple myeloma (cancer of white blood cells)


Neuromas (tumor in the nerves)


Angiomas (tumor in the blood vessels)

5. Degeneration
It is usually seen in construction or heavy load workers as their age advances. Degeneration of the lumbar spine and surrounding tissues can lead to the development of the following which eventually leads to back pain:


Spondylosis deformans: It is characterized by the presence of bony spurs or osteophytes along the edges of the bones of the spine.


Lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration: It is marked by the breakdown of one or more of the discs that separate the bones of the spine.


Lumbar non-spondylolysis spondylolisthesis: It occurs when one vertebra slips out of place onto the vertebra below it.


Ankylosing spinal hyperostosis: It is a fusion of the vertebral column resulting from the formation of bone tissues in the ligaments without significant disc disease or joint involvement.


Lumbar spinal stenosis: It is a narrowing of the spinal canal in the lower part of your back.


6. Infections
 Some infections can also lead to back pain. These include:


Infection of the spine and discs


Epidural abscesses (the fluid-filled cavity between the bones of the spine)


Muscular/soft tissue abscesses


7. Pregnancy
Studies have shown that the majority of women experience back pain, which affects their daily  activities, quality of life, and ability to work.

Carbuncle 


This is also the progressed form of folliculitis. In this, an aggregate of hair follicles develops. These aggregates form large swollen lesions that often open and discharge.
All of the above infections are usually caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species. ","Diagnosis Of Bacterial skin infections
 
Most diagnoses of bacterial skin infections are made through physical examination. 
The following laboratory tests are used to determine the type of infection and assess complications in cases of severe clinical symptoms:
 
1. Blood tests


Complete blood count: A persistent bacterial infection often causes a rise in the white blood cell count, which is determined through a complete blood cell count. The test also helps to distinguish a bacterial infection from a viral infection.


 
Here is the complete information about the CBC test.Tap to Know


C-reactive protein (CRP): CRP is an inflammatory marker whose level increases during an infection. The detectable rise in CRP can take up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. 


Procalcitonin is a type of protein released by various cells after a serious bacterial infection. An elevated level of procalcitonin may be a sign of sepsis. 


 
2. Skin culture
It involves examining a sample of skin, tissue, or exudates taken from the infected site. This test detects the type of microbes causing the infection and helps guide the right treatment plan.

","Symptoms Of Bedwetting
 
The main symptom of bedwetting is involuntary urination during sleep. It is considered a medical condition only when it occurs at least twice a week in children older than 5 years of age for at least 3 months. 
The presence of more than “four” episodes of urination in “a week” is termed as “frequent.”
Individuals having lower urinary tract dysfunction may experience the following additional symptoms:


Pain in the lower urinary tract


Increased frequency of urination (≥8 times/day)


Repeated leakage of urine, even during daytime


A sudden and immediate urge to urinate


Pain while urinating


Straining (application of pressure at the abdomen while urinating)

","Causes Of Bedwetting
 
The different proposed theories behind bedwetting are:
1. Increased urine production at night
Typically, the production of urine diminishes at night due to the increased production of a hormone known as ADH (antidiuretic hormone), a natural process in the body.
Some studies have shown that decreased nocturnal ADH production at night might contribute to bedwetting. 
2. Bladder overactivity
The bladder's fullness causes contraction of the muscles, which leads to emptying. Any defect in these muscles can cause bedwetting. Children with bladder overactivity usually also have daytime symptoms such as urgency of urination. 
3. Role of central nervous system
Sleep cycle and urination are both controlled by the brain. Several studies have found some people have frequent arousals with inability to awaken completely. This causes the bladder brain dysfunction which can lead to bedwetting. ",,"Diagnosis Of Bedwetting
 
The diagnosis of bedwetting involves a series of steps based on the presence of other symptoms.
1. Medical history and clinical examination
Obtaining the history and tracking the symptoms are the most important for all children who present with bedwetting. The essential aspects that are considered include:


Determining the pattern of bedwetting episodes in one night and the number of nights per week


Asking about the intake of caffeine or other fluids before going to bed


Determination of the amount of urine


Raising questions regarding increased thirst, difficulty in urination, urgency, frequency, daytime incontinence, abnormal urinary stream, and constipation


Obtaining a family history of involuntary urination


Determining history of recurrent urinary tract infections 


Asking about sleep disorders, snoring, or a diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing


Knowing about the use of chronic medications


Screening for psychological or behavioral disturbances, including attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and learning disabilities


Finding out stressor


2. Physical examination
In some cases, bedwetting can be due to spinal malformations. A back examination can rule these disorders out. Dimples and hairy patches over the back are signs of a disturbed spine at birth.
3. Urine routine and microscopy
A complete urinalysis is the only preferred test in children without other symptoms. The urine is tested for the presence of: 


Urinary tract infections


Glycosuria (glucose in urine)


Proteinuria (protein in urine)


Hematuria ((blood in urine)


In various cases, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine tests are also performed to assess kidney function.
4. Imaging studies
These tests are usually recommended in children who present with multiple other symptoms also, along with bedwetting. It includes:


Kidney ultrasound (to look for kidney damage)


KUB ultrasound ( to assess the assesses the condition of your kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder)


Spine MRI (to check for spinal malformations)

1. Adjust the intake of fluids
Children should be trained for the intake of fluids. Some specific adjustments surely help in bringing down the episodes of bedwetting. These include:


Avoiding soda and caffeinated beverages such as tea and coffee


Keeping the child hydrated


Having 2/3rd of the fluids during the morning to early afternoon and then the other 1/3rd the remainder of the day


Avoiding the consumption of any fluid before 1-2 hours of going to bed


2. Practice timed voiding
Practice going to the bathroom regularly instead of waiting for the urge to go. This will prevent the bladder from overfilling and thus reduce the chances of bedwetting. Inculcate a habit of going to the washroom once every 3-4 hours in your child. 
3. Empty bladder before bedtime
It is very important  to empty the bladder right before bedtime. This helps in reducing the episode of bedwetting to a greater extent.
4. Improve sleep hygiene
Maintaining a sleep routine helps improve the symptoms of several sleep-related disorders, including bedwetting. It also helps improve nocturnal bladder control.

The alternative therapies for bedwetting include:
1. Urotherapy
This involves giving the child behavioral training, which includes limiting fluid intake before bed, enhancing awareness of daytime voiding (the process of removing urine), and voiding before bedtime.
2. Motivational therapy (positive reinforcement)
It involves giving the children prizes or stickers for following the urotherapy guidelines. It is helpful for the children who are motivated to treat their bedwetting. 
This technique has shown a reduction in relapse rate and bedwetting frequency in children between 5 to 7 years of age having mild symptoms ( <7 nights/week)
3. Biofeedback 
The technique records individuals' responses, such as heart rate, muscle tension, brain activity, etc., after stimulation. By analyzing the triggers, it helps alleviate physical and emotional symptoms.","Living With Bedwetting
 
Bedwetting can have both physical and emotional impacts on a child’s life. It does not resolve immediately with treatment. The journey to dry night is a progression that requires a lot of patience from both the child and the caregiver. 
Role of caregivers -  Managing emotional aspect
Bedwetting can be a frustrating and embarrassing condition for a grown-up child. These children may suffer from poor self-esteem. As per the study, children with chronic bedwetting problems are more likely to develop behavior problems, such as aggressive behavior and attention problems.
 
The following measures from a parent/caregiver help in managing the emotional fluctuations in a child:


Reassure and educate the child about bedwetting


Give answers to every question of the child


Support the child and let them know that various kids have the same problem


Try to minimize the number of investigations by preparing well in advance by recording the symptoms well in advance


Understand the fact that bedwetting is not in control of your child instead of blaming them


Set a no-teasing rule in the family in which nobody is allowed to tease the child


Do not punish or reprimand the child, as it can make the feeling of shame even worse


Reward the child not for dry nights but for adhering to the treatment guidelines


Ease any anxiety or stress during bedtime by creating a quiet environment. Read a book together, massage the child, or tell the stories

",,"Causes Of Cataract
A cataract is a lens abnormality characterized by decreased transparency and increased cloudiness. The eye's lens is usually clear and made of mostly water and protein. 
Crystallins are the main proteins that make the lens and the lens surfaces. They are responsible for the lens's refractive function. These proteins are arranged in a particular fashion that keeps the lens clear and allows light to pass through it. This helps the lens to focus a clear image onto the back of the eye or retinal surface.
Changes in the arrangement and alterations in the character of the lens proteins result first in increasing rigidity of the lens and eventually causing cataract.","Risk Factors For Cataract
There are several risk factors for cataract development that can be classified as:
Age
Age-related (or senile) cataract is defined as a cataract occurring in people >50 years of age. It becomes progressively more severe and frequent in the elderly and is responsible for 48% of world blindness.
Gender
Women are at a higher risk for most cataracts than men, probably due to a lack of estrogen (reproductive hormone) in post menopausal years.
Racial or ethnic groups
In comparison to Europeans, white people and persons with Asian ancestry have higher prevalence rates. 
Genetics
Genes play an important role in the development of cataract. If your parents had cataract then there is a chance that you might also get cataract.
Traumatic injury
Damage to your lens because of serious injury to the eye can lead to cataract. This cataract can form quickly after the injury or take many years.

Certain Medications

Studies suggest that long term use of  corticosteroids can lead to cataracts.

Smoking

The ill effects of smoking on the lungs are known to all. It is a known major risk factor for cataract as well.
Alcohol consumption
Alcohol increases the risk of cataracts as the lens is sensitive to the direct toxic effects of alcohol.
 
Radiation
Certain types of radiation, like ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and radiation therapy for cancer, may predispose to cataract. 
 
Systemic diseases
Disorders that increase the risk of the development of cataract include:
Diabetes: Poor control of diabetes mellitus (DM) is linked to several eye complications, including cataracts.

","Diagnosis Of Cataract

Cataracts are visible during clinical evaluation of the eye. The following steps are used evaluate cataracts:
1. History taking

Your healthcare provider will ask about your health history, which comprises the following:


Your chief complaint, i.e. a decrease in vision, any family history of cataract a


Past eye history


Any systemic disease causing or aggravating the symptoms


Your current medications


2. Comprehensive eye examination

The comprehensive eye exam will include dilation(eye drops will widen your pupils) to examine the eye. Tests include:


Visual acuity test: This is the eye chart test. It checks for the ability to see from different distances.


Refraction test: This test assesses the sharpness and clarity of vision. Both eyes are tested individually for their ability to see letters of varying sizes.


Cover test: This test is used to determine if you have a squint as a faulty vision caused by cataract can lead to a squint. 


Slit-lamp test: This exam is used to detect issues such as cataracts, eye injuries, and a lens clouding.


 
3. Other eye investigations


Visual acuity test: The test measures how well your distant vision is.


Pupil dilation test: This test is done to purposefully widen the pupils so that the eye doctor can examine the eyes thoroughly.


Tonometry test: This test measures the fluid pressure in the eye.


Contrast sensitivity testing: This test is similar to the visual acuity test and is based on differentiating between shades of grey.


Glare testing: It is based on the fact that vision in different light settings may be altered in cataracts.


Color vision testing: This helps detect acquired color vision defects.


Potential acuity testing: This gives an idea of vision after cataract removal.


Spectacular photographic microscopy: This is done before cataract surgery to see the health of the endothelium.

","Prevention Of Cataract

Cataract cause multiple complications discussed as follows:
Disease-related complications



Corneal ulceration: It is an open sore on your cornea (the transparent part of the eye that allows light to enter the inside)





Corneal perforations: It is a potentially devastating complication that can lead to corneal melting





Iritis: It is swelling and irritation in the colored ring around your eye's pupil


 


Subluxation of the lens: The lens is considered subluxed when it is partially displaced but remains within the lens space





Secondary glaucoma: Any form of glaucoma in which there is an identifiable cause of increased eye pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss





Blindness: Cataract is the leading cause of blindness, accounting for 50% of blindness worldwide. 



Surgery-related complications 



Uveitis: It refers to eye inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye wall, between the retina and the sclera (white of the eye).





Posterior capsular thickening: It occurs when a cloudy layer of scar tissue forms behind the lens implant. It is common within the first 6 months after surgery.





Aphakia: It means not having a lens inside your eye. Absence of lens can make the eye out of focus, and vision blurry. It can be caused by surgery for cataracts. 





Glaucoma: Cataract surgery can increase the eye's pressure. This can damage the eye's optic nerve, leading to glaucoma. 





Retinal detachment: Retinal detachment is a condition that develops when the retina, a light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye, is yanked away from its normal location.





Hyphema: It is the accumulation of red blood cells (RBC) in the anterior chamber of the eye.





Corneal burn: Also known as eye burn, it can result when certain chemicals used during the procedure come into contact with your eyes.





Opacification: Often referred to as ""secondary cataract,"" it is the most common postoperative complication of cataract.

","Types Of Cervical Cancer
Cervical cancers and cervical pre-cancers are classified based on their appearance on a microscope. They are most commonly of two types: 
Squamous cell carcinoma
It is the most common type (80% to 90%). These cancers develop from the outer cells of the cervix (exocervix). Squamous cell carcinomas most often begin in the transformation zone (where the outer cells join the inner cells of the cervix).
Adenocarcinomas
This is the other type (10% to 20%) that develop from the mucus-producing gland cells of the inner cells of the cervix (endocervix).Less commonly, cervical cancers have features of both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas and are called adenosquamous carcinomas or mixed carcinomas. Here’s more on the common signs of cancer.Click Here!","Symptoms Of Cervical Cancer

Cervical cancer symptoms are usually mild in the early stages and can go unnoticed. Symptoms according to the stage of cancer include:
Early or stage 1 cervical cancer
In the early stages of cervical cancer, a person may experience no symptoms at all. Some of the signs and symptoms of stage 1 cervical cancer can include:


Watery or bloody vaginal discharge 


Foul odor in the vaginal discharge


Vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse


Bleeding in between menstrual periods


Longer and heavier menstrual periods

Blood in urine


Diarrhea


Fatigue


Weight loss


Loss of appetite


General feeling of being ill


Dull and aching pain in the back


Swelling in the legs

Note: It can take almost 20 years for the precursor lesion caused by sexually transmitted HPV to develop into an invasive form of cervical cancer. Learn what the experts have to say about cervical cancer.","Causes Of Cervical Cancer
Almost all cervical cancers are caused by sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV). This is the same virus that causes genital warts. There are more than 1000 strains of human papillomavirus, but only certain types can cause cervical cancer. The two types that most commonly cause cancer are HPV-16 and HPV-18.The major mechanisms through which HPV contributes to cancerous activity involve the viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, which interfere with major tumor suppressor genes (P53 and retinoblastoma). In addition, E6 and E7 have been associated with changes in host and viral DNA. Most people will get HPV at some point in their lives and not realize it as the body fights against the infection. However, if the body fails to fight this infection, it can cause the cells of your cervix to change to cancerous cells. HPV can spread from the following:


Any direct skin-to-skin contact of the genitals 


Vaginal, anal, or oral sex


Sharing sex toys

","Risk Factors For Cervical Cancer

A number of risk factors for cervical cancer are linked to exposure to HPV. High-risk types, especially HPV16, are prevalent in the human population, and infection is usually transmitted by sexual contact, causing squamous intraepithelial lesions. Most lesions disappear after 6−12 months due to the intervention from the immune system. However, a small percentage of these lesions remain and can cause cancer. There are also other numerous risk factors for cervical cancers which include:
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections
According to studies, the risk of developing an infection from high-risk HPV types is higher in women with HIV. The results showed a relationship between HIV and cervical cancer that suggested a higher rate of persistent HPV infection with multiple viruses with cancerous activity, among people with HIV.
Multiple sexual partners
Many studies have suggested that women with multiple sexual partners are at high risk for HPV acquisition and cervical cancer. Multiple sexual partners of the spouse can also be an additional risk factor.
Excessive use of oral contraceptives
Oral contraceptive (OC) pills are known to be a risk factor for cervical cancer. It has been reported in a study that the use of OC for 5 years or more can double the risk of cancer. In addition, the use of OC pills is an associated risk for developing cervical cancer, especially adenocarcinoma. 
Smoking
Smoking increases the chance of developing precancerous lesions of the cervix (called moderate or severe dysplasia) and increases the chance of developing cervical cancer. Smoking greatly increases your risk for dysplasia and cancer, and weakens the immune system, increasing the chances of getting affected by HPV. In addition to increasing the risk of cervical cancer, smoking can lead to premature pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy and also affect reproductive health. Here's more on smoking can affect women's health.Click To Read!

Hygiene patterns

Several genital hygiene patterns showed an association with cervical cancer. Not using a sanitary napkin, not maintaining vaginal hygiene, and not taking special care in cleaning their genitals when washing increases the risk of infections. Lack of particular care in cleaning the genitals can increase he risk of cervical cancer by 5.6 times.
Weak immune system
Having a weakened immune system caused by immunosuppression increases the risk of HPV infection and cervical cancer. Immunosuppression weakens the body’s ability to fight infection and other diseases.","Diagnosis Of Cervical Cancer
Early stages of cervical cancer don't usually involve symptoms and are hard to detect. The first signs of cervical cancer may take several years to develop. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classified cervical cancer stages into the following:Stage 0: Also known as carcinoma in situ, it is the presence of abnormal cells in the innermost lining of the cervix.Stage I: Invasive form of cancer that is only confined to the cervix.


Stage Ia cervical carcinoma: Preclinical invasive carcinoma that can be diagnosed only by means of microscopy.

Stage Ib cervical carcinoma: Clinically visible lesion that is confined to the cervix uteri.

Stage Ib1: Primary tumor not greater than 4.0 cm in diameter.

Stage Ib2: Primary tumor greater than 4.0 cm in diameter.

Stage II: The locally limited spread of cancer beyond the uterus but not to the pelvic sidewall or the lower third of the vagina.


Stage IIa cervical carcinoma: Spread into the upper two-thirds of the vagina without parametrial (the fat and connective tissue that surrounds the uterus) invasion.

Stage IIb cervical carcinoma: Extension into the parametrium but not into the pelvic sidewall.

Stage III: Cancerous spread to the pelvic sidewall or the lower third of the vagina, and/or hydronephrosis or a non-functioning kidney that is incident to invasion of the ureter.


Stage IIIa cervical carcinoma: Extension into lower one-third of the vagina, without spread to the pelvic sidewall.

Stage IIIb cervical carcinoma: Extension into the pelvic sidewall and/or invasion of the ureter, with the latter resulting in a non-functioning kidney or hydronephrosis.

Stage IV: Cancerous spread beyond the true pelvis or into the mucosa of the bladder or rectum.


Stage IVa cervical carcinoma: Extension of the tumor into the mucosa of the bladder or rectum.

Stage IVb cervical carcinoma: Spread of the tumor beyond the true pelvis and/or by metastasis into distant organs.

Finding abnormal cells during cervical cancer screenings is the best way to avoid cervical cancer. Cervical cancer diagnosis requires the following:
A physical exam and complete medical history
Examining the whole body to check general signs of health, including checking for any signs of disease like lumps or anything unusual. Past medical history, patient’s health habits, and prior illnesses and treatments will also be taken.
Pelvic exam
An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum is done. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.
Traditional pap smear
A pap smear, also called a pap test, is a procedure to test for cervical cancer in women. It involves collecting cells from your cervix.Here's everything you need to know about pap smear.Click To Read!

Liquid-based cytology (LBC) 

Liquid-based cytology (LBC) is a new method of preparing cervical samples for cytological examination and unlike the conventional 'smear' preparation, it involves making a suspension of cells from the sample and this is used to produce a thin layer of cells on a slide. 
Visual inspection with acetic acid & Lugol’s iodine (VIA/VILI)
Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is a visualization of a woman's cervix to detect precursors of cervical cancer after application of acetic acid (ordinary table vinegar) on her cervix. Healthcare workers (midwives, nurses, and clinical officers) can practice VIA at several levels of healthcare settings.
HPV testing
The HPV test is a screening test for cervical cancer, but it doesn't confirm if an individual has cancer, instead, the test detects the presence of HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer, in the system. HPV-based testing is a pivotal part of cervical cancer screening besides cytology-based tests. The application of HPV detection has accelerated the transition of cervical cancer screening from morphology to molecular biology. 
Computerized screening
Because human fatigue and error may be major contributors to false-negative readings of Pap smears, computer-assisted image analysis, and artificial intelligence have been introduced as a means of improving the sensitivity of the Pap smear. Artificial intelligence (AI) has also shown promising results in screening and examination based on image pattern recognition. 
Endocervical curettage
This is a procedure to collect cells or tissue from the cervical canal using a curette (spoon-shaped instrument). Tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for any signs of cancer. 
Colposcopy
A procedure in which a colposcope (a lighted, magnifying instrument) is used to check the vagina and cervix for abnormal areas. Tissue samples may be taken using a curette (spoon-shaped instrument) or a brush and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.
Biopsy
This is done if the pap smear shows any abnormal cells. A sample of tissue is cut from the cervix and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. 
Imaging 
These tests help doctors find out where the cancer is located and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. They include:1. Computed tomography (CT) scan: It involves taking pictures of the cervix at specific times after the intravenous (IV) injection of contrast medium to find out exactly where the tumor is in relation to nearby organs and blood vessels. 2. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or PET-CT scan: A PET scan is usually combined with a CT scan or MRI scan to produce images of the inside of the body. The combination provides a more complete picture of the area being evaluated.Women’s cancer awareness package is a group of tests clubbed together to detect cancer markers in women.

There are more than 100 kinds of HPV and about a dozen of them have been shown to lead to cancer. The two most important things to prevent cervical cancer are to get the HPV vaccine and to get tested regularly according to American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines. These include:
Undergoing cervical screening
Early detection of the types of HPV that can cause cancer is key in preventing cervical cancer. A well-proven way to prevent cervical cancer is to have screening tests. Screening is having tests to find conditions that may lead to cancers and can find pre-cancers before they can turn into invasive cancer. Finding precancerous lesions through regular screening can limit the cases of cervical cancer to a greater extent.
Getting HPV vaccine
The HPV vaccine can help prevent HPV infection by protecting against HPV. Vaccines are available that can help protect children and young adults against certain HPV infections. These vaccines only work to prevent HPV infection and will not treat an infection that is already there. These vaccines help prevent pre-cancers and cancers of the cervix. Some HPV vaccines are also approved to help prevent other types of cancers and anal and genital warts.Note: India accounts for around 16% of the total deaths caused by cervical cancer across the world. And it can be prevented with a vaccine. Learn more about vaccine to prevent cervical cancer: age, types, schedule & more.Tap To Read!
Limiting exposure to HPV
HPV is passed from one person to another during skin-to-skin contact with an infected area of the body. Although HPV can be spread during skin-to-skin contact; vaginal, anal, and oral sex doesn't have to occur for the infection to spread. It is even possible for a genital infection to spread through hand-to-genital contact.Also, HPV infection seems to be able to spread from one part of the body to another. This means that an infection may start in the cervix and then spread to the vagina and vulva.HPV exposure can be limited by:


Encouraging the partners to talk with a doctor or nurse about the HPV vaccine


Not having sex when there are visible warts


Limiting the number of sex partners


Avoiding sex with people who have had many other sex partners


Not having unprotected sex
Some methods used to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) decrease the risk of HPV infection. The use of a barrier method of birth control such as a condom, and dental dams during oral, anal, and vaginal sex can help protect against HPV infection. 
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle
There are a lot of cancer prevention clinical trials that aim to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.","Specialist To Visit

 ","Treatment Of Cervical Cancer
Different types of treatment are available for patients with cervical cancer. They include:
A. Surgical procedures
Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. Surgical procedures opted for cancer that has not spread beyond the cervix include:1. Conization: A procedure in which a cone-shaped piece of abnormal tissue is removed from the cervix. A scalpel, a laser knife, or a thin wire loop heated by an electric current may be used to remove the tissue.2. Hysterectomy: A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the womb (uterus). A hysterectomy can be:


Simple hysterectomy: It is the removal of the uterus and cervix. 

Radical hysterectomy: It is the removal of the uterus, cervix, upper vagina, and the tissue around the cervix. A radical hysterectomy also includes the removal of the surrounding lymph nodes.

3. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP): This procedure uses a wire loop heated by an electric current to remove cells and tissue in the cervix and vagina. It is used as part of the diagnosis and treatment for abnormal or cancerous conditions.4. Exenteration: This surgery is done if cancer has come back within the pelvis (the lowest part of your tummy, between your hips). This procedure removes the cervix, uterus, and ovaries.5. Radical trachelectomy: It is a surgery to remove the cervix, nearby tissue and lymph nodes, and the upper part of the vagina. It can be used to treat women with early-stage cervical cancer to preserve their fertility. After the cervix is removed, the uterus is attached to the remaining part of the vagina.6. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove both the ovaries and fallopian tubes. It is done at the same time as a hysterectomy.
B. Radiation therapy
Uses high-energy x-rays or other particles to destroy cancer cells. Radiation therapy may be given alone, before surgery, or instead of surgery to shrink the tumor. The types of radiation therapy include:


External-beam radiation therapy: The most common type of radiation in which the radiation is given from a machine outside the body. 




Internal-beam radiation therapy: When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. Brachytherapy involves the application of a radioactive source in close proximity to the tumor. 


Note: For the early stages of cervical cancer, a combination of radiation therapy and low-dose weekly chemotherapy is often used. This is done to increase the effectiveness of the radiation treatment. 
C. Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells, usually by keeping the cancer cells from growing, dividing, and multiplying of cells.For people with cervical cancer, chemotherapy is often given in combination with radiation therapy (concurrent chemoradiation). The chemo helps the radiation work better. Options for concurrent chemoradiation include:


Cisplatin: This drug is given weekly during radiation. This drug is given into a vein (IV) before the radiation appointment. 


Cisplatin with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): This combination is given every 3 weeks during radiation.


The chemo drugs most often used to treat cervical cancer that has come back or metastasized include:


Cisplatin


Carboplatin


Paclitaxel 


Topotecan


D. Targeted therapy
In this treatment, specific genes, proteins, or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival are targeted. This type of treatment blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells and limits damage to healthy cells.For recurrent or metastasized cervical cancer, platinum-based chemotherapy combined with the targeted therapy is used. Targeted therapy uses the following:


Bevacizumab 


Bevacizumab-awwb 


Bevacizumab-bvzr 


Tisotumab vedotin 


E. Immunotherapy
This therapy uses the body's natural defenses to fight cancer by improving your immune system’s ability to attack cancer cells.The immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab is used to treat cervical cancer that has recurred or metastasized during or after treatment with chemotherapy. It may also be used with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in people with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.",,"Home-care For Cervical Cancer

","Symptoms Of Chikenpox

The symptoms caused by chickenpox infection appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus and usually last about 5 to 10 days.The initial symptoms may resemble any other infection. At the beginning of chickenpox, a person may begin to feel unwell, have bodyache and headache, accompanied by loss of appetite. After one or two days these are followed by the appearance of the classic rash of chickenpox. One is contagious to close contacts up to 48 hours before the skin rash starts to occur. The common non rash symptoms of chickenpox are as follows:


Fever is the most common symptom of chickenpox. It usually lasts for 3-5 days and is in the range of 101°–102°F (38.3°–38.8°C).


Fatigue or Malaise which is the general feeling of being unwell


Loss of appetite


Headache


Muscle or joint pain


Flu-like symptoms such as a cough or runny nose


Once the chickenpox rash and blisters appear on the body, they go through the following three phases:


Red or pink-looking bumps (papules) are often first noted on the stomach, chest, back, or face areas, which then spread throughout the body.


The bumps eventually get filled up with fluid, forming blisters (vesicles)that begin to break open and leak.


The blisters develop a crust, scab, and begin to heal. 


All the blisters are not formed at the same time. New blisters keep on developing throughout the infectious period. However, they follow the same phases as explained above.
All symptoms are typically mild for young children. Those who have been vaccinated (including children and adults) can also still get an infection, but symptoms will be milder and produce fewer blisters on the body.
However, in severe cases of chickenpox rashes and blisters start spreading throughout the body. In some cases, small lesions may even form on the throat, around the eyes, and in the mucus membranes of the urethra, vagina or anus.
In some cases rashes are accompanied by symptoms of disorientation, dizziness, shortness of breath, a rapid heartbeat, a cough (which worsens), poor muscle coordination, and a stiff neck. These symptoms could indicate another possible medical condition or complication which may require prompt medical intervention.","Causes Of Chickenpox

Chickenpox is caused by the virus varicella zoster. It mostly spreads due to close contact with an infected person. The virus can spread through:


Coughing or sneezing via respiratory droplets


Kissing or sharing drinks or food through saliva


Handshaking or hugging through contact with the blisters or the fluid on the skin


Touching contaminated surfaces like door handles or tables, etc

",,,,"Specialist To Visit

In most cases, the symptoms of chickenpox are usually mild and often go away on their own. However, visiting a clinician and early intervention may lead to slow progression and early resolution of disease. There are times, especially in adults, when the symptoms of chickenpox become severe and may fail to show any signs of improvement. In such a case it is wise to consult a doctor to get it treated. 
You must see a doctor if you experience symptoms such as:

Vomiting
Shortness of breath
Rash on the eyes
Stiffness of neck
High fever (over 102 F)
Bacterial infection
Loss of muscle control
Dizziness

","Treatment Of Chickenpox

Chickenpox usually runs its course in a week or 10 days. The treatment is mostly aimed at relieving the symptoms. Non Aspirin products such as Paracetamol can be taken to reduce fever.
In adults and those with severe symptoms of chickenpox, doctors might prescribe antiviral medication as it can make the symptoms less severe and improve the condition. However, ensure to follow the course of the treatment and do not self-medicate. Some of the common antivirals used include:

Acyclovir
Famciclovir
Ganciclovir
Ribavirin
Valacyclovir

Do’s and Don’ts


As a protective measure, those infected are usually required to stay at home while they are infectious. 


It is advised to not use OTC medications such as aspirin for fever as it is associated with Reye’s syndrome in kids. It is a severe disease that affects the brain and may even cause death. 


Avoid the use of anti-inflammatory painkillers without consulting your doctor as it can increase the risk of severe skin infections.


Daily cleansing with warm water will help avoid secondary bacterial infection. 


Keeping nails short and wearing gloves may prevent scratching and reduce the risk of secondary infections. 

","Home Care For Chickenpox

1. Do not scratch the itch
One of the key symptoms of chickenpox is itchy skin and hence, it is advised to avoid scratching. This is because it not only increases the risk of scars but also can lead to infection. As a safety measure, you can trim the fingernails of your kids, which can prevent skin infection caused due to scratching. Tap or pat on the itchy skin but do not scratch.

2. Use cold compress
Chickenpox also causes fever, which in turn can make you more prone to skin itching and scratching. Increased body temperature can make things worse for a person with chickenpox. This is the reason why it is advised to use a cold compress as it not only helps in lowering the body temperature but also soothes itchy skin. Apply a cool, damp compress over the itchy area as it acts as one of the effective chickenpox remedies. 

3. Eat healthy, home-cooked food
It is quite common to crave for spicy and processed food when you are ill. However, it is best to avoid indulging in spicy, oily or salty foods as these not only hinder your digestion process but can also increase heat in the body. Hence, it is best to opt for home-cooked foods, preferably bland foods, to improve the healing process. Also, up your intake of fruits which are rich in Vitamin C and boost immunity such as oranges, apples, grapes, lemons, etc.

4. Stay hydrated
Drink lots of fluids as it helps you to stay hydrated and prevent dehydration caused due to high fever. Moreover, it can also help to flush the viral toxins from the body and aid in quick recovery. However, avoid drinking sugary beverages and opt for fresh, plain water, especially if you or your kid has sores in the mouth. For kids, you can opt for sugar-free popsicles to replenish fluid stores in the body.

5. Wear gloves
This tip mostly applies to kids because they are the ones who are more prone to scratch an itchy skin. This is the reason why it is advised, especially for kids, to put gloves or socks over their hands to prevent scratching. This can not only prevent the direct content of the nail with the chickenpox blister but also lower the risk of infections and limit scarring. Also, wear loose, cotton clothes, which will help the skin to breathe and ease the itching.

6. Avoid self-medication
Most people tend to pop a pill for fever or a painkiller for body ache without a second thought when suffering from chickenpox. However, this is not a good idea. Aspirin, which is commonly used to relieve fever, can cause a deadly condition known as Reye’s syndrome in children below 16 years of age. Hence, do not self-medicate but consult your doctor before taking any pills. ","Complications Of Chickenpox

Chicken pox is usually a mild disease. However, complications can happen from chickenpox. They are more common in adults and people with weak immune systems like:


Infants


Pregnant women


Patients with conditions like HIV/AIDS, cancer, chemotherapy, steroid therapy, transplants


Some of the serious complications of chickenpox include:


Secondary Bacterial infections


Dehydration


Pneumonia (infection of the lungs)


Encephalitis (inflammation  and swelling of the brain)


Cerebellar ataxia (defective muscular coordination)


Transverse myelitis (inflammation of spinal cord)


Bleeding


Sepsis


Toxic shock syndrome


Reye's syndrome in children and teenagers who take aspirin during chickenpox


Death


Chickenpox And Shingles
Although shingles and chickenpox are caused by the same virus, they are not the same illness. Chickenpox is usually a milder illness that affects children. Shingles results from a reactivation of the virus long after the chickenpox illness has disappeared.
The chickenpox virus stays in the body even after recovery. Later in life, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles. If you have shingles, you can spread the varicella virus to people who have never had chickenpox or never received the chickenpox vaccine. These people will develop chickenpox, not shingles. It takes from 10 to 21 days after exposure to chickenpox or shingles for someone to develop chickenpox. ","Alternative Therapies Of Chickenpox

In addition to antiviral medications, there are few home remedies that are known to help relieve the symptoms and help to get rid of scars caused due to scratching. However, make sure to consult your doctor before you try any of these chickenpox remedies.

1. Oatmeal bath
Oatmeal bath is one of the most popular natural remedies to relieve itchy skin caused due to chickenpox. For this, you need to cook two cups of oatmeal in two liters of water for around 15 minutes. Now, let it cool and tie the cooked oatmeal in a cotton cloth and allow it to float in a tub of warm water till the water becomes turbid. Splash this water all over the body to soothe itching.
2. Baking soda
This is also quite commonly used to get rid of itching in people with chickenpox. Add 1/4th teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of water. Dip a soft, cotton cloth in it and dab it on the skin such that the baking soda dries on the skin. This can keep you away from scratching the blisters.

3. Vitamin E oil
Rich in antioxidant, Vitamin E oil can help to relieve itching as well as prevent scars caused due to scratching of chickenpox blisters.  Gently apply Vitamin E oil all over the skin as it exerts a calming and soothing effect on the skin and thus, promotes healing. Moreover, regular application of this oil was found to lighten the scars/marks caused due to chickenpox."

","Symptoms Of Chikungunya  
The symptoms of chikungunya typically appear 2 to 12 days after a person has been bitten by an infected mosquito. The most common symptoms of chikungunya include:


Abrupt onset of fever or chills
Severe joint pain and swelling
Joint stiffness
Knee pain 
Shoulder pain
Muscular pain
Headache
Nausea
Rashes and redness of the skin
Fatigue or tiredness
Abnormal bleeding tendency
Skin blistering
","Causes Of Chikungunya 

Chikungunya is a viral disease that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species.

When an uninfected mosquito bites a person infected with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the virus enters the mosquito's body. After a few days, the virus spreads to the mosquito's salivary glands. 

When the mosquito bites another person, the CHIKV enters the bloodstream and spreads throughout the body, infecting various tissues, including muscle cells and immune cells. In the new person, the virus multiplies and reaches high levels in their blood, causing symptoms of chikungunya.

This virus can enter the body through the skin, when we breathe (respiration), through the mouth (ingestion), through sex (vaginal, oral, anal) or close sexual contact, or to an unborn baby through the placenta or birth canal.

The virus primarily targets cells in the joints, leading to inflammation and severe joint pain.","Risk Factors For Chikungunya 

While anyone can contract chikungunya, the following risk factors may increase the likelihood of infection or the severity of the disease:



Staying or traveling to regions where chikungunya is endemic or experiencing outbreaks.


Living in areas with inadequate mosquito control measures, such as stagnant water sources or poor sanitation.


Spending time outdoors, especially in areas with high mosquito populations. Mosquito exposure is more likely during the daytime, particularly around dawn and dusk when Aedes mosquitoes are most active.


Wetter and hotter months of the year.


Individuals who have not been previously infected with chikungunya.


Infants, young children, older adults, and individuals with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions.



Ever wondered why mosquitoes prefer biting you over others?
There might be times when you might have wondered why mosquitoes bite you more than others. Well, this could be because of:


'O' Blood type 


Mosquito attracting genes


Pregnancy 


Consumption of alcohol



The rationale behind this is that alcohol consumption, pregnancy, and even physical activity raise your metabolic rate, causing you to exhale more carbon dioxide, which in turn attracts more mosquitoes.",,"Prevention Of Chikungunya 
Presently there is no approved vaccine for the prevention of chikungunya. 
Two vaccine candidates, one made from a modified measles virus and another using virus-like particles, have completed initial tests. More research and trials are underway before the vaccine is approved for public use.
In the absence of a vaccine, the most effective way to avoid chikungunya is by taking measures to protect yourself from mosquito bites.

1. Preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites




Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when working outdoors during the day to reduce the risk of mosquito bites.


Install window and door screens to keep mosquitoes out of your living areas.


Avoid outdoor activities during times when mosquitoes are most active.


Use mosquito nets or screens around beds to create a barrier against mosquitoes.


Consider using mosquito zapping devices, such as electric bats, to control the mosquito population.


To minimize mosquito attraction, switch your outdoor lights to yellow ""bug"" lights. While not repellent, these lights tend to attract fewer mosquitoes compared to regular lights.


Apply mosquito repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, IR3535, Para-menthane-diol (PMD), or oil of lemon eucalyptus.



Pro Tip: Apply sunscreen before applying mosquito repellent.

2. Tips for babies and children


Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para-menthane-diol (PMD) on children under the age of 3.


Avoid applying insect repellent on a child's hands, eyes, mouth, cuts, or irritated skin.


When using insect repellent for children, adults should first spray it onto their own hands and then apply it to the child's face.


After returning indoors, wash your children's skin with soap and water to remove any repellent, and wash their clothing before they wear it again.


Avoid using sprays in pressurized containers that children may accidentally inhale or get into their eyes.



3. Products for preventing mosquito bites


Mosquito repellent bands: Worn on the wrist, they come in chemical (DEET-impregnated) and natural (essential oils) varieties.


Mosquito patches: Stickers stuck on clothes (collars, sleeves, skirts, shorts) available in chemical and herbal forms.


Body lotion or mosquito sprays: Synthetic repellents (DEET, permethrin) or natural repellents (citronella) for protection.


Mosquito repellent sticks: Similar to incense sticks, loaded with repellents, used in open spaces like gardens, terraces, or balconies.


Mosquito nets: Conventional option with fine wire mesh (18 x 18 strands per inch) for beds or window screens.


Additional repellent products: Apart from these repellents, there are products like blankets, floor cleaners, electric zappers and table-top fumigation machines, which help keep mosquitoes away.

4. Tips to prevent mosquito breeding



Avoid excessive watering of potted plants and ensure that trays are emptied to prevent them from becoming breeding grounds.


Regularly change the water for indoor plants and decorative items that can collect water, such as bird baths, tabletop fountains, flower vases, and fish tanks.


Empty water from trays under air conditioners, refrigerators, and other containers like pet or bird feeding bowls.


Clean these containers at least once every 15 days to disrupt the mosquito breeding cycle, which typically lasts around 15-20 days.


When not in use, turn over empty pails and buckets, and cover containers with tight-fitting lids to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.


Use dustbins with properly fitting lids and dispose of trash daily, as uncovered trash cans attract mosquitoes.


Implement regular fogging with mosquito repellents or larvicides, and consider spraying pesticides like DDT in potential mosquito breeding areas.

Read this article","Treatment Of Chikungunya 

The main treatment for Chikungunya fever focuses on relieving symptoms, such as drinking enough fluids, resting, and using paracetamol for pain and fever relief. The treatment can be broadly divided into two phases:

1. Acute phase
After a silent incubation period of 2 to 4 days, patients generally display the chikungunya symptoms that may persist 3–7 days during the acute phase of the disease. The following treatment protocols are usually followed during this phase:
Rest should be one of the main recommendations as physical activities tend to aggravate the joint pain, contributing to local wear and thus to prolonging the clinical condition. 

Certain local measures like the application of cold compresses or ice packs and pain relief gels to the affected joints can reduce swelling and pain.

The two most commonly used medications prescribed for mild to moderate pain are Paracetamol and Metamizole. NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin are usually avoided because of the risk of bleeding.

In the case of severe-intensity pain, Paracetamol or Metamizole might be combined with opioids like Tramadol.


2. Post acute phase
While most patients start showing signs of recovery after a week, in some cases chronic and incapacitating joint pain can persist. 


In the case of moderate to severe pain that is not responding satisfactorily to the medications in use, other drugs must be recommended. Among these options are disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), like methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine or sulphasalazine.

Once the pain subsides, the pain relief medications are suspended; conversely, if the pain persists, corticosteroids like prednisolone might be prescribed at an anti-inflammatory dose. 



Note: Special considerations are made for pregnant women and children in terms of medication choices.

","Symptoms Of Dandruff

Dandruff is a common scalp disorder characterised by:


Flaky white to yellowish scales on the scalp


Itching of the scalp


Dry or oily scalp


Flakes due to dry scalp tend to be smaller and whiter. Dandruff flakes are larger and usually yellow-tinged due to oily scalp. 
Signs your dandruff may be severe:


Large areas of redness or swelling on the scalp


Severe itching and worsened flakes over time


Having symptoms even after using anti-dandruff shampoo for a month

",,"Causes Of Dandruff

The causes of dandruff vary from person to person, but it is usually a result of improper handling of hair and scalp. According to experts, the cause of dandruff is rapid maturing and shedding of scalp cells precipitated by excessive oil secretion.
Broadly speaking, the causes can be categorised into:
 
1. Microbial factors
A) Fungal infection
Malassezia, a fungi, is one of the leading causes of dandruff. It is known to stimulate the enzyme lipase which is responsible for the production of saturated fats and unsaturated fats. While saturated fats aid in the growth and division of the fungal cells, unsaturated fats are responsible for skin inflammation and irritation. Moreover, it also alters the normal shedding of the dead cells leading to visible white flakes.
 
B) Bacterial infection
Bacteria that can be found on the scalp and may lead to dandruff include Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
 
2. Non-microbial factors


Dry scalp


Oily or irritated skin/hair


Poor hair hygiene


Use of hair cosmetics/tools


Scalp disorders like psoriasis and eczema 


Infrequent shampooing


Extreme weather conditions

","Diagnosis Of Dandruff

Dandruff is diagnosed by a simple physical examination of the scalp. You may even be asked a few questions about your hair care routine and symptoms. It will be done by a dermatologist (skin specialist) or a trichologist (hair and scalp specialist). Your dandruff may be classified as mild or severe and on the basis of it, your doctor may prescribe appropriate treatment. There are no blood tests or imaging tests to diagnose dandruff.","Prevention Of Dandruff

By taking adequate measures to improve hair health, you can minimize the chances of dandruff. 


Cut down on high sugar foods, fats and alcohol


Develop a hair and scalp care routine according to your hair type. If you tend to have an oily scalp, frquent shampooing may help prevent dandruff. Gently massage your scalp to loosen flakes. Rinse thoroughly. If your hair tends to be dry and your scalp is sensitive, shampoo less frequently and condition your scalp in between washings.


Limit hair-styling products. Hair-styling products can build up on your hair and scalp, making them oilier.


Brush your hair often to improve circulation in the scalp.


Do not share combs 


When going out, cover your hair as dirt and grease aggravates the problem

",,"Treatment Of Dandruff

In most patients, dandruff can be controlled by daily washing with gentle anti dandruff shampoo. If your dandruff is severe, the doctor may prescribe medicated shampoos that contain chemicals such as Zinc Pyrithione, Selenium sulphide, Ketoconazole, Coal Tar and Salicylic Acid.
 
These treatment options are aimed at treating the cause of the dandruff and managing the symptoms.

1. Antifungal agents
As the name suggests, this class of drugs are aimed at treating the fungus which is responsible for the dandruff. Most of these drugs work by affecting the membrane of the fungus which leads to death of the microbes thereby aiding in the treatment. Examples of this class of drugs include:


Zinc Pyrithione helps to prevent itching and flaking


Ketoconazole acts as a broad spectrum antifungal agent by disrupting the membrane function


Climbazole works by hindering the normal functioning of the fungal cell membrane


Selenium Sulphide based shampoos can discolor the hair and scalp.


Clotrimazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol (a type of fat) thereby aiding in the treatment


Piroctone Olamine inhibits the degradation of sebum triglycerides to oleic acid and arachidonic acid which are responsible for inflammation and itching


 
2. Anti-proliferative agents
Coal tar is used in the form of tar based shampoos and it is one of the most common examples of this class of anti-dandruff chemicals. It contains more than 10,000 of chemical compounds that inhibit proliferation (division of the microbes) and inflammation. This is mainly used to relieve the symptoms of dandruff.
 
3. Keratolytics
It acts as a keratolytic agent which is known to cause the skin to shed dead cells from the top layer by increasing the moisture in the scap. As it prevents clumping of the dead cells together it helps to clear dandruff from the scalp. Salicylic acid is one of the most common examples of keratolytic agents.
These drugs are available in various forms such as shampoos, lotions/applications, creams, herbal oils and gels.","Home Care For Dandruff

By making small changes in your lifestyle, you can get rid of dandruff effectively. Here are some effective ways to manage dandruff:
1. Brush your hair regularly
Brushing your hair ensures that blood circulation in your scalp is maintained. When you brush your hair, you remove dead cells from your head. But brushes with sharp ends will cause swelling and reddish patches in your scalp. Use a paddle brush. Brushes that have balls in the ends are even milder. 
2. Avoid harsh shampoos
Certain chemicals in shampoos can lead to dry and irritable skin and precipitate itching and dandruff. Choose a mild herbal shampoo that is gentle on the hair and has a compatible pH balance.

3. Avoid styling tools
Heat and chemicals make your hair weak and damage the scalp. Straightening, blow-drying, and perming or any kind of artificial heat can cause irreparable damage and precipitate dandruff.

4. Pick an anti-dandruff shampoo
Some commonly recommended anti-dandruff shampoos available over the counter are Pyrithione zinc shampoos, Tar-based shampoos and Ketoconazole shampoo. It is recommended to use these shampoos daily however as dandruff gets better, alternate it with some other shampoo to avoid loss of hair health.

5. Eat healthy
Enrich your diet with optimum portions of green vegetables, fish oil, lean proteins and fruits. Include green leafy veggies such as broccoli, kale, lettuce to your daily diet. It encourages and improves your skin, hair, nails and overall health. Lean proteins (eggs, nuts, beans) help in building healthy skin and hair. So add these to your daily servings in some or the other form.

6. Get a little sun
Sunlight may be good for controlling dandruff. But because exposure to ultraviolet light damages your skin and increases your risk of skin cancer, don't sunbathe. Instead, just spend a little time outdoors. And be sure to wear sunscreen on your face and body.","Complications Of Dandruff

Dandruff should not be taken lightly because


It may be pointing towards overgrowth of a fungus (called Malassezia) which despite being present on the scalp of most people does not cause any symptoms


It can slow down your hair growth


It denotes a microinflammation, which might be easily overlooked as there are no readily observable symptoms.


So if you have dandruff or itchy scalp with white flakes, do consult a dermatologist to know the cause of it and get it treated before it becomes severe in nature.","Alternative Therapies For Dandruff

","Symptoms Of Dehydration 

Symptoms of dehydration in adults and children include:



Fatigue


Thirst


Dry skin and lips


Dark urine or decreased urine output


Headaches


Muscle cramps


Lightheadedness


Dizziness


Fainting or passing out


Palpitations


A sudden drop in blood pressure when you suddenly stand from a seated or lying down position.



Signs of dehydration in infants may include:



Wrinkled skin

Being drowsy or irritable


A sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on top of their head


Sunken eyes


Few or no tears when they cry


Cool, discolored hands and feet


Sleeping too much 



Here are some of the common signs and symptoms of dehydration in adults explained in detail.Click to read","Causes Of Dehydration
The adult human body is composed of up to 60% water. To keep cells and tissues healthy, it must maintain a delicate balance of fluids and electrolytes (including sodium chloride, potassium, calcium, and sodium bicarbonate). Water is primarily absorbed through the digestive tract. The kidneys remove waste and excess fluid and excrete it as urine.
 
Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid and electrolytes than it takes in, and you don't have enough to function normally.  A lack of fluid disrupts that balance and jeopardizes your body's ability to regulate its temperature and function properly.
 
The various causes of dehydration include:


Prolonged physical activity with excessive sweating without consuming adequate water, especially in a hot and/or dry environment


Prolonged exposure to dry air, e.g., in high-flying aeroplanes (5% to 12% relative humidity)


Blood loss due to physical trauma


High altitude


Diarrhea


Vomiting


Long term fasting


Recent rapid weight loss


Inability to swallow


Excessive use of caffeine and other stimulants


Excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages


Severe burns



Some infectious diseases that may cause dehydration include:


Gastroenteritis


Cholera


Typhoid fever


Yellow fever


Malaria



Medical conditions that are usually associated with dehydration include:


Diabetes mellitus


Diabetes insipidus


Addison disease 


Salt-wasting nephropathies


Hypoaldosteronism


Intestinal obstruction


Acute pancreatitis

","Types of Dehydration

Dehydration is classified under three categories depending on

1. Hypotonic (deficiency of electrolytes especially sodium)
2. Hypertonic (primarily loss of water)
3. Isotonic (loss of both water and electrolytes in equal ratio)","Diagnosis Of Dehydration

The doctor often diagnoses dehydration based on physical signs and symptoms.


Physical examination- Absence of tears, sunken eyes, palpated pressure, dry mucous membrane, thirst, change in blood pressure, and so on are all part of the physical examination.


However, to pinpoint the level of dehydration, the doctor may request a few tests, such as:


Blood tests- Blood samples may be used to rule out the root cause of infection (either virus, bacteria, or fungal) such as the levels of your electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine, etc. 


Urinalysis- Urine tests can determine whether or not you are dehydrated and to what extent. They can also look for signs of a bladder infection and crystal formations or kidney stones etc. 


Urine toxicology- Some medicines can lead to dehydration too like Marijuana. For example- methamphetamine is a drug that is used to diagnose urine toxicology. 



Note: Babies and kids may not show the same signs of dehydration that adults do. If your baby or child is showing signs of dehydration, contact their doctor for advice.","Prevention Of Dehydration

Here are some ways to keep dehydration at bay:


Examine the inside of your mouth for signs of dehydration. A healthy mucus membrane should be red, moist, and have good turgor. You can check this by looking inside your mouth. 


Drink the recommended amount of fluids even if you are not physically active. Don't put off drinking until you're thirsty. Drink fluids throughout the day, whether you're thirsty or not.


If you plan to exercise or participate in sports, increase your water intake. Drink water or electrolytes after exercise as well.


Have extra electrolytes on hand whenever you are ill, such as when you have a fever, vomiting, dysentery, or diarrhea, as this can result in fluids or electrolyte loss. 



Here are a few tips to prevent dehydration from dysentery or diarrhea.Click here


In hot weather, dress coolly and avoid being out in direct sunlight if possible. Also, in hot weather, drink more water.


Eat a balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables. They are high in water, salt, and vitamins and can help prevent dehydration.


Limit your intake of coffee, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages. They are diuretics, which means they remove water.

The treatment of dehydration depends on age, the severity of dehydration, and its cause. You also may be treated for diarrhea, vomiting, or a high fever if the illness caused dehydration.
For Babies:


Feed your infant a lot of liquids, such as formula or breast milk. Prefer giving children smaller amounts of fluid more regularly.




Don't dilute your baby's formula (if you use it). Extra water can be given to formula-fed and solid-fed babies.




Avoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly if they have diarrhea and vomiting, as it can aggravate their condition.




In addition to their regular feed (breastmilk, formula milk, and water), giving your infant regular sips of oral rehydration solution (ORS) will help to replace lost fluids, salts, and sugars.


For Infants and Children:
The most important treatment for young children suffering from vomiting or diarrhea is to keep them hydrated. This entails providing ample amounts of breast milk, formula, electrolyte solution, or other fluids.
Infants and children who have become dehydrated due to diarrhea, vomiting, or fever should not be given only water. Because it can dilute the already low mineral levels in their body, exacerbating the problem. Instead, they should have diluted squash or oral rehydration salts (ORS).

Take lesser quantities more regularly if you or your child is having trouble keeping fluids down due to vomiting. To give your child small amounts of fluid, you may find it easier to use a spoon or a syringe.

Mild dehydration:
Dehydration causes the loss of sugar, salts, and water. It is frequently treated by drinking rehydration solutions that contain electrolytes and aid in the restoration of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium.

Here’s more on everything you need to know about ORS and its role in dehydration.Click here to read
Severe dehydration:
For moderate to severe dehydration, you may need IV (intravenous) fluids. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency. It needs to be treated right away with IV fluids in a hospital.
Note: Even if patients get intravenous (IV) rehydration, they should start drinking ORS as soon as they are able.
In particular, babies, infants, and elderly people will need urgent treatment if they become dehydrated.

Acupuncture and acupressure are two techniques commonly used to manage chronic vomiting. During acupuncture, a therapist inserts thin needles into specific points on the body. Acupressure aims to stimulate the same points of the body but uses pressure instead of needles to do so. Both techniques stimulate nerve fibers, which transmit signals to the brain and spinal cord and are believed to decrease nausea.
2. Aromatherapy therapy
This type of therapy may help relieve nausea and vomiting, although studies on its effectiveness are mixed. To practice aromatherapy, try deep breathing with an open essential oil bottle, or an essential oil diffuser, or add a few drops to a cotton ball.

","Symptoms Of Dementia

A person can be suspected to have dementia if he/she exhibits the following symptoms: 

A progressive loss of memory, which may start as simple forgetfulness and gradually increase to an extent where the person cannot recollect vital information, such as his/her name, address, etc.
Problems in performing basic tasks, such as grooming, wearing clothes, eating, etc., that he/she could complete with ease previously. 
Difficulty establishing new memories and learning new things.
Loss of ability to communicate effectively. The patient may struggle to remember even simple words.
The patient is often confused and disoriented.
Other psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, inappropriate behavior, paranoia, and hallucinations, may also be present.
","Causes Of Dementia

There are many causes of dementia and result in various neurological disorders like: 
Dementia of Alzheimer’s disease
This is the most common type of dementia and accounts for 70-80% of all cases of dementia. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease have abnormalities in their brain, like deposition of beta-amyloid proteins or plaques and tangles in the brain which damage healthy neurons and are thought to cause the symptoms. Another feature is the loss of connection between neurons in the brain which transmit messages between different parts of the brain, and from the brain to muscles and organs in the body.
Fronto-temporal dementia
Degeneration of nerve cells in the brain’s frontal and temporal lobes leads to this type of dementia with associated personality changes, mood alterations, and abnormal behavior.
Vascular dementia
When the blood supply to the brain is hampered by a stroke, injury, or abnormal blood pressure, it damages the neurons and leads to memory problems, resulting in cognitive decline.
Lewy-body dementia
Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of protein found in the brain in neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease. This type of dementia is associated with stiffness and rigidity in the body and slow, uncoordinated movements.
Other brain disorders
Certain neurological conditions, such as traumatic brain injury, Huntington’s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc., may also cause symptoms of dementia like memory loss, speech difficulties, etc.
Mixed dementia
This is a type of dementia that occurs due to an overlap of different causes.
Progressive dementia
All types of dementia described above are progressive types that often begin with mild symptoms. There is no possibility of a complete cure for such types of dementia. 
Reversible type dementia
These types of dementia can be improved if the underlying  causative factor is taken care of. These dementias can be due to nutritional deficiencies, infections, medications effect, hormonal imbalances, brain tumors, hydrocephalus, excess fluid buildup in the brain, poisoning, etc. Correcting these causative agents usually helps improve the symptoms.","Risk Factors For Dementia

Certain factors are known to increase the risk of dementia, such as: 
Age: The risk of dementia increases with increasing age, especially after 65 years. However, it is not a part of the normal aging process, which is a common misconception.
Family history: Chances of dementia are higher if a close family member suffers from dementia due to the same genetic sequencing.
Chronic illness or diseases: Comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, etc., increase the risk of dementia.
Nutritional deficiencies: A diet deficient in vitamin B complex can increase the risk of dementia.
Alcohol abuse: Excessive alcohol consumption can increase the risk of dementia.
Medications: Certain antidepressant medications like amitriptyline, anti-allergy medications like diphenhydramine,benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, opioids may increase the risk of dementia.","Diagnosis Of Dementia

To evaluate a person with memory loss, the doctor takes a detailed history about the onset of symptoms, notes family history, and evaluates the patient's neurological and psychological condition with physical and cognitive assessments. Certain supporting lab tests and imaging studies may be required to establish the cause of dementia. 
Lab Tests: Laboratory tests to evaluate dementia include Thyroid profile total, Vitamin B-12, Vitamin D (25-OH), Complete blood count (CBC), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Protein electrophoresis CSF, etc. check for infectious conditions, autoimmune conditions, or nutritional deficiencies as these are other potential causes of dementia. Depending on the test results, further more detailed tests may be recommended to confirm the findings.
Imaging Studies: CT scan (Head), MRI brain, MR angiography brain, CT angiography brain are useful to study the structural changes to the brain and surrounding vasculature in-depth.
Others: EEG (Electro-Encephalograph), Electrocardiography (ECG), and Echocardiography may be required to evaluate brain and heart activity.
With timely preventive health check-ups, one can spot and address risk factors for certain diseases that might crop up with old age. Read more on the need for preventive health check ups for the elderly. Read Now!","Treatment Of Dementia

The treatment for dementia mainly consists of supportive care and treating the causative factors wherever possible. Medical management consists of the following: 
Medicines to Improve Cognitive Functions
The common types of medications prescribed to patients with dementia to improve their cognitive symptoms. 


Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: These drugs prevent the breakdown of acetylcholinesterase enzymes which helps in taking care of the symptoms but do not have any effect on the progression of the disease. Examples of drugs in this class are Donepezil, Galantamine, and Rivastigmine.


Nerve-protecting medicine: This class of drugs nourishes the nerve cells, protects them from damage, and improves their survival. Examples include Citicoline.


N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists: These are drugs that decrease the activity of glutamate, thereby controlling the symptoms. The formulations that belong to this class are Memantine.


Antioxidant drugs: These drugs help to improve the symptoms of dementia by fighting the free radicals that could be responsible for symptoms such as decline in memory. The class of drugs which are popular include Coenzyme Q10, Ginkgo biloba, Saint John’s Wort, etc


Nootropic drugs: These drugs which include piracetam target α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA ) receptors, that play a key role in the transmission of signals across synapses in the brain. By stimulating or suppressing certain signal transmissions in the brain, piracetam may help to decrease cognitive impairment and improve mental acuity.


Ibuprofen: It is a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor designed to relieve pain, decrease inflammation, and reduce fever. It decreases the production of nitric oxide (NO), protects neurons against glutamate toxicity, and decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines thereby controlling the symptoms of dementia. 


Statins: This class of drugs are known to help in the treatment of certain types of dementia caused by small blockages in blood vessels that carry blood to the brain. Statins may help to reduce these blockages and improve the symptoms.



Medicines to Calm Anxiety and Improve Sleep
Often, patients with dementia also suffer from anxiety, irritability, depression, and sleep disturbances. Anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications that help calm these symptoms are prescribed.

Other Medicines for Reversible Causes of Dementia


Supplements: Sometimes dementia is caused by nutritional deficiencies. Correcting these with vitamin supplements such as Polybion SF Syrup and Meg-B12 Capsules can help reverse dementia.


Antidiabetics & antihypertensives: Treating diabetes with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin and hypertension with antihypertensives is essential if dementia is found to be a complication of these comorbidities.


Antibiotics & anti-inflammatory drugs: Any infection or inflammatory condition in the body must be treated with appropriate antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs if dementia results from an infection or inflammation in the body.

",,"Specialist To Visit

The symptoms of dementia are often observed by close family members or loved ones. When a person starts forgetting important or routine things often and displays changes in behavior, speech, and other cognitive abilities, it is essential to evaluate him/her for probable dementia. The specialists who can diagnose and treat dementia are: 


Neurologist

Exercise and Yoga: Performing light exercises can help enhance mood, manage anxiety in patients with dementia, and maintain their physical activity status. These light exercises can include home-based aerobic routine, dancing as a form of exercise, lifting light weights, and yoga such as Pranayama.
Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy: Certain modifications suggested by physiotherapists or occupational therapists may need to be implemented in a patient’s home or work environment to make it safer and prevent injuries due to falls.
Massage Therapy and Aromatherapy: Massage therapy and aromatherapy induce relaxation and may be helpful for patients with dementia.
 
Ayurveda: Dementia is known as Smrutibuddhirhass in Ayurveda. Panchkarma and medicinal herbs like Shankhpushpi, Guduchi, Bhrahmi, Ashwagandha, Shatavari, etc., may be useful in treating dementia.","Living with Dementia

Often, receiving a diagnosis of dementia can be a life-altering and challenging situation for patients and their caregivers. Coming to terms with the diagnosis can invoke feelings of anxiety, depression, anger, rage, guilt, etc. However, it is important to remember that a diagnosis of dementia does not necessarily mean the end of life. It is possible to live a happy life even after being diagnosed with dementia.


Make sure that the person understands the diagnosis and its health implications. 


Motivate the patient to stay socially active, such as going to a movie or taking a walk in a park. Engage them in community activities like attending functions or help them join a support group. 


Encourage them to spend time with friends and family.


Love, understanding, patience, and reassurance are cornerstones of living with a loved one who has dementia.

","Home Care For Dementia

It is important to ensure safety and quality of life for patients suffering from dementia. Caring for a relative or loved one who is suffering from dementia can be challenging and often tiresome. Here are a few things that can help with home care for dementia patients. 
1. Encourage the person to maintain a diary or calendar to note down important things or days, which will help them remember.
2. Always keep the atmosphere at home pleasant, positive, and caring. Never make the patient feel that they are a burden.
3. Ensure that the patient has access to important data, such as identity documents, home address, important telephone numbers, etc., at all times. This can help in situations where the patient loses his/her way home or is unable to remember their identity or whereabouts.
4. People with dementia are often at an increased risk of falls due to concurrent motor issues. Hence, take care and ensure that their surroundings are well-lit, spacious, and free of obstacles.
5. Do not allow a patient with dementia to drive or operate heavy machinery.

","Symptoms Of Dengue
The symptoms of dengue can be confused with other common illnesess such as flu, malaria, and chikungunya. However, dengue should be suspected if you develop a sudden onset of high-grade fever (above 104 degree celcius) along with rash, nausea and body ache.   According to the WHO, dengue can be categorised into 3 phases: 


Febrile phase
Critical phase
Recovery phase



1. Febrile phase 
This phase usually lasts 2-7 days and is often accompanied by:

Generalized body ache
Eye pain (pain with eye movement)
Muscle pain 
Joint pain 
Headache
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Vomiting 
Facial flushing
Skin rashes
Respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, congestion, etc)


2. Critical phase
The fever usually decreases around the 3rd to 7th day of illness. This marks the beginning of the critical phase. It is followed by extreme fatigue which can last for a few days to weeks. There could also be a rapid decrease in the platelet & leucocyte (white blood cell) count. In some cases, there can be severe organ impairment & internal bleeding.
3. Recovery phase
Post critical phase, there is an improvement in the condition of the patient in the following 48-72 hours. In this phase, there is an improvement in the appetite and gastrointestinal symptoms. There might be a reappearance of skin rash in the recovery phase.
Note: In younger children, these symptoms are generally mild but older kids and adults may have moderate to severe symptoms depending on the intensity of the infection.
Signs of severe dengue
As per the CDC, about 1 in 20 people who get sick with dengue may develop a severe form of dengue. After the first sign of dengue appears, it may take around 3-7 days for the disease to turn into a severe condition. This is the critical phase which can even lead to a drop in the temperature which is not a sign that a person is recovering but a sign that special care is needed. The warning signs which indicate severe dengue are:

Severe abdominal pain
Rash all over the body
Bleeding gums
Blood in vomit
Rapid heart rate
Low blood pressure
Difficulty in breathing
Fatigue/ restlessness
Severe bleeding

In case you suffer from any of these symptoms, it is advised to immediately get admitted to a hospital and follow your doctor’s suggestions without fail.
Suspect that your fever is due to dengue? Get a dengue test from the comfort of your home.BOOK TEST HERE","Causes Of Dengue
Dengue is a viral infection caused by the bite of a female Aedes Aegypti mosquito. The virus that causes dengue is known as dengue virus (DENV), which belongs to the family of Flaviviridae viruses. There are four different types of dengue virus namely DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4.
When the mosquito infected with dengue virus bites a healthy person, the virus spreads into the bloodstream causing the infection. The mosquito that causes dengue can be identified by characteristic black and white markings over its body. It breeds in stagnant water and is mostly seen during early hours of the day. Infection with any one of the serotypes confers lifelong immunity from that particular strain.","Risk Factors For Dengue
You may be at a high risk of suffering from dengue if:

There are several cases of dengue in your locality.
Your area has pooled water or if you work in construction sites as the risk of breeding mosquitoes is high in such areas.
You travel to places where the prevalence of dengue is high.
",,,"Treatment Of Dengue
There is no specific treatment for dengue. This is the reason why the treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. Most patients with dengue fever have mild illness and can be treated at home by following strict dietary guidelines and course of medication. In case of severe dengue, where the platelet count drops severely (a condition known as thrombocytopenia), platelet transfusion is advised. 
1. Take sufficient rest 
As dengue causes severe fatigue and high fever, make sure you rest as much as possible and give your body sufficient time to recover.
2. Bring down your fever

Antipyretic drugs like paracetamol can help to bring down the temperature and also relieve body aches.
Drugs such as aspirin and other painkillers should be avoided as they may increase the risk of bleeding/hemorrhage.
Antibiotics are generally not required.
Sponging the person with cool water can help to reduce fever.

3. Stay hydrated
Dehydration is a common complication of dengue as water is lost due to fever, vomiting and not drinking enough fluids. So to prevent it, make sure you stay hydrated by drinking fluids in the form of coconut water, buttermilk, fruit juices, lemon water, milk and drinks with electrolytes along with water. If you experience any of these signs of severe dehydration, then it is wise to consult a doctor immeditely to prevent complications.
4. Monitor your condition
The period after the fever starts to subside is critical. Some people develop warning signs such as vomiting (at least 3 times in 24 hours), difficulty in breathing, bleeding from the nose or gums and blood in vomit/stool within a day or two after the fever goes down. This is seen in around 1 in 20 people with dengue and may require hospitalization as it could be life-threatening. So be extra careful and keep a close eye on the warning signs.REMEMBER! Severe dengue is a medical emergency and warrants immediate medical care at a hospital.
5. Try home remedies
Few home remedies are found to be quite popular in the treatment of dengue fever as they have been known to increase the platelet count.
Papaya leaves: According to a research (Subenthiran S, et al), the juice of papaya leaves is known to inhibit the growth of dengue virus and increase platelet count. 
Giloy: Packed with anti-inflammatory and antipyretic (fever reducer) properties, giloy juice is known to aid in the management of dengue fever. It not only increases platelet count but also improves immunity aiding in quick recovery.
Kiwi: Many people believe that eating kiwi fruit daily improves platelet count. However, there is no research study to prove its efficacy in increasing the platelet count. The fruit is rich in Vitamin C which not only acts as a potent antioxidant but also boosts immunity.Watch this video to know more about the tests, treatment and what to eat and avoid in dengue.",,"Complications Of Dengue
Rarely, severe dengue can be complicated by organ damage and internal bleeding (dengue hemorrhagic fever). This results in sudden drop in blood pressure, feeble pulse, hypovolemia and eventually dengue shock syndrome.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has laid down criteria for a diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. These are:

Low platelet count (<1 lac)
Fever for 2 to 7 days
Hemorrhagic manifestations (internal bleeding)

In the early stages, the platelet count is usually within normal range but hemoglobin level may be high. If the hemoglobin level is raised (>14g/dL), a doctor should be consulted even if the platelet count is in the normal range. The platelet count begins to fall once the fever starts to come down. Even when the platelet count is falling, there is no need to panic.REMEMBER! There is no role of platelet transfusions in a patient who has no active bleeding. Do not insist your doctor for platelet transfusion in the absence of bleeding.",,

Symptoms Of Dental Pain

Dental pain can vary in intensity from mild to severe. It can also range from dull-aching pain to sharp-shooting pain based on the causative factors. A range of symptoms can be seen with dental pain such as:

Dull-aching toothache that may radiate to the gums or jaws.
Pain that worsens while biting or chewing food.
Pain exacerbated by excessively hot or cold foods or sweets.
Pain accompanied by bleeding or discharge from the gums.
Swelling of the gums or face, which may be accompanied by a fever.
Occasionally, a bad mouth odor and bad taste in the mouth may be present, along with toothache.
","
Causes Of Dental Pain

There can be multiple causes of dental pain such as:

Fracture of the tooth
Dental caries or tooth decay that cause cavities and infection in the tooth
Periodontal or gum infections
A dental abscess, i.e., a collection of pus or fluid near the tooth, which occurs in tooth infections
Erosion of tooth enamel and gum recession
Lack of space for eruption of wisdom teeth
Accumulation of food particles and debris between the teeth
Repetitive clenching or grinding of teeth
Loose or fractured old filling or a cracked tooth cap
Ill-fitted dentures or braces
","
Risk Factors For Dental Pain

Dental pain is most commonly seen in children and adolescents, with a prevalence rate ranging around 9.4%. It is more common in the lower socio-economic population who have limited access to quality healthcare. Dental pain is also common in the elderly population and is the primary reason for dental procedures in the elderly population.
 
Additionally, the risk of dental problems is more often associated with the following:


Poor oral hygiene


Excessive consumption of sweets, starchy or acidic food and drinks


Smoking


Diabetes


Weak immune system due to certain medications (such as chemotherapy for cancer) or certain diseases (such as HIV)


Xerostomia or dry mouth due to inadequate salivation which can happen after injury to head or neck, after radiation therapy or as side effect of certain drugs


Heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can cause stomach acid to flow into the mouth, leading to dissolution of enamel and thereby causing tooth damage.


Eating disorders like Anorexia and Bulimia can lead to wearing of teeth and cavities. They also affect production of saliva.


Many parents are in a dilemma about their child’s dental care. They know they don’t want their kid to get cavities but don’t know how to go about preventing them. Here are some tips to ensure your toddler gets proper tooth care.Click Here To Know More!",,,"
Treatment Of Dental Pain

The treatment for dental pain is broadly divided into providing pain relief and treating the underlying cause.
1. Medicines for dental pain relief


NSAID painkillers are prescribed to provide relief from mild to moderate dental pain.


Opioid painkillers or combination medicines are prescribed to treat severe dental pain.


Anti sensitivity toothpastes can provide some relief from sensitivity of teeth.



2. Treatment of underlying cause



Antibiotics are prescribed by dentists to treat dental infections


Mouthwashes are also recommended to combat infections



3. Dental procedures 

These procedures can be advised if needed and may include:


Scaling and planing- In case of plaque accumulation and gum infection,the dentist may carry out professional cleaning or scaling of teeth or numb the gums to remove plaque buildup below the gum line.


Cavity filling - For a shallow cavity in the tooth, the dentist will remove the decay and seal the tooth with a filling.


Root canal treatment (RCT) - In case of a deep cavity that infects the pulp of the tooth, the dentist will perform a root canal treatment. In this procedure, all the vital contents of the tooth (nerves and blood vessels) are removed and the root canal system is sealed with an inert filling material. RCT is usually followed by a dental cap or crown.


Tooth extraction - If the tooth is badly damaged and cannot be saved, it may be advised to get it extracted.

","
Home-care For Dental Pain

If you have mild dental pain, home remedies may provide considerable relief. Home remedies are also useful in alleviating symptoms of severe disease. You can do the following at home to help ease dental pain:


For many people, rinsing the mouth with lukewarm saline water is an effective first-line treatment. Saline water is a natural disinfectant, which helps in reducing inflammation and ease any pain or swelling.You can mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a glass of lukewarm water and use it as a mouthwash.


Applying an ice pack or cold compress externally can help reduce inflammation and swelling and thereby give some relief in pain.


Avoid eating foods that are hard to chew. Do not chew on the painful side.


You can apply clove oil or peppermint oil to the affected area. It is known to help with pain relief from toothaches.


Do not consume excessively hot or cold foods or sweets as these may worsen the sensitivity and increase your pain.


Gently brush your teeth at least twice a day. Rinse and gargle after every meal to avoid food particles from getting stuck in between the teeth.

","
Complications Of Dental Pain

A toothache on its own does not cause any severe complications and in most cases, tooth infections can be easily treated.
Sometimes, tooth infection can cause an abscess in which pus is collected inside the tooth or gums. In very rare cases, delay in treatment can cause this infection to spread to other areas of the body resulting in any of the following complications:


Sinusitis: can occur rarely from untreated upper teeth infection


Osteomyelitis: Infection of the bone surrounding the tooth


Ludwig angina: Submandibular space infection


Cavernous sinus thrombosis: Infection of the blood vessels within the sinuses


Cellulitis: An infection of the skin and fat directly beneath the skin


Parapharyngeal abscess: An abscess at the back of the mouth


Septicemia: Medical condition in which the immune system overreacts to an infection in the blood


These conditions can be life threatening and require immediate attention and intervention.
The following signs and symptoms may indicate any possible spread of infection to other parts of the body:


High fever


Chills


Swelling of the face or the jaw


Foul-smelling discharge from the tooth


Nausea


Vomiting


Severe headache


Itching or burning sensation on the skin


Drooping eyelids


Double vision


Confusion

Alternative Therapies For Dental Pain

1. Ayurveda: Dental or oral health is called ‘Danta Swasthya’ in Ayurveda. There are various Ayurvedic practices which can be opted for good oral health, such as:


Chewing sticks of medicinal trees, like Neem, Meswak, etc., are used as an alternative to conventional brushing techniques. While chewing these sticks, the medicinal extracts get released into the mouth, which helps promote and maintain healthy teeth and gums.


Oil pulling is an ancient practice that involves swishing oils inside the mouth. Sunflower oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil is used for oil pulling. This has been used as a traditional remedy to prevent teeth and gum diseases.


Medicinal condiments and herbs like clove, garlic, vanilla extract, peppermint, wheatgrass, thyme are found to be useful in relieving dental pain and are famously used as home remedies to treat toothaches.


2. Homeopathy: Homeopathy is an alternative form of medicine that follows the principle of ‘like kills like’. Homeopathy doctors prescribe diluted tinctures that elicit symptoms similar to those the patient is already experiencing. 


Tinctures of Belladonna and Arnica Montana are found to be useful in relieving toothaches. 


Calcarea carbonica, Chamomilla, Antimonium crudum, etc., are also helpful in relieving dental pain. 


Arsenicum album is effective in treating gum diseases, such as bleeding gums.


You can prevent tooth pain by following basic oral hygiene such as brushing and flossing your teeth twice a day and regularly visiting your dentist’s clinic.

Living With Dental Pain

Dental Pain or Toothache is one of the commonest pain experienced by patients worldwide. It’s normal to occasionally battle with tooth pain because of sensitive teeth, gums infections or dental cavities. Though good and consistent oral hygiene measures help in preventing a lot of dental problems, sometimes, as much as one tries to brush twice a day, floss every day, and eat a healthy diet, one can still suffer from dental issues. For eg. Some may be genetically predisposed to have more brittle,sensitive teeth or more acidic saliva. Unfortunately, some can suffer from any form of accident resulting in fracture of teeth and thereby resulting in dental pain.Dental pain can come with a lot of annoyance and irritation. Continuous pain can lead to avoidance of food and thereby causing nutritional deficiencies or weight loss. Due to heightened dental sensitivity patients may not be able to enjoy their favorite sweets or ice-cream. Another cause of concern in patients with dental infections is bad breath or foul odor coming from the mouth. This can lead to extreme social embarrassment or isolation.Prevention of a disease is always better than its cure. Good oral hygiene practices and routine visits to the dentist are essential to keep the teeth and gums healthy life-long. In cases where dental problems happen in spite of taking precautions, one should not be disheartened as most dental problems are easily treatable and have a good outlook. Home remedies and a prompt visit to the dentist without much delay can go a long way in getting relief from toothache."

","Symptoms Of Ear Pain 
Ear pain is most commonly described as a feeling of pressure in the ear. This feeling may begin gradually or suddenly, and it can be very severe.The symptoms of ear pain in adults include:


Hearing loss


Fever 


Fluid drainage from the ear


Ringing of the ear


Vertigo


In young children, the signs of an ear infection may be the following:


Fever 


Irritability 


Pulling of the ear 


Loss of appetite 


Difficulty in sleeping


Difficulty in responding to sounds 


Fussiness and crying


Loss of balance

","Causes Of Ear Pain
Injury, infection, and irritation in the ear are the common causes of ear pain. 
I. Ear infection 
It is usually caused by bacteria and often begins after a child has a sore throat, cold, or other upper respiratory infection.The ear has three major parts -- the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. If the upper respiratory infection is bacterial, the same bacteria may spread to the middle ear and if the upper respiratory infection is caused by a virus, such as a cold, bacteria may move into the middle ear as a secondary infection. 


Outer ear infection: The outer ear, also called the pinna, includes everything we see on the outside; it is the curved flap of the ear leading down to the earlobe. The outer ear infection is caused by swimming, wearing headphones that damage the skin inside the ear canal, or putting cotton swabs in the ear canal.


Middle ear infection: The middle ear is located between the eardrum and the inner ear. The infection can start from a respiratory tract infection and leads to a buildup of fluid behind the eardrums caused by the infections. 


Inner ear infection: This part contains the labyrinth, which helps in maintaining balance. The other part is the cochlea, a part of the labyrinth, which is a snail-shaped organ that converts sound vibrations from the middle ear into electrical signals. The infection of the inner ear is labyrinthitis which is sometimes caused by viral or bacterial infections from respiratory illnesses.


II. Symptoms of other conditions


Ear pain with a toothache in children who are teething. Individuals with an infected tooth having an abscess or impacted wisdom teeth are more likely to have an ear pain.


Ear pain with a change in hearing, earwax build-up, an object stuck in the ear (do not try to remove it yourself – see a GP), and perforated eardrum (particularly after a loud noise or accident).


Ear pain with pain when swallowing in case of sore throat, tonsillitis, and quinsy (a complication of tonsillitis).


Ear pain with a fever, flu, cold or sinusitis.


III. Ear wax 
It is part of the body's protective mechanism to lubricate the ear canal and prevent infection. If the wax hardens and builds excessively, it may cause significant ear pain, if the wax presses against the eardrum.
IV. Insertion of a foreign object 
When a foreign body is inserted into the ear, it causes pain and inflammation. These may include hairpins and pointed objects that are often used to scratch or remove ear wax.
V. Certain medical conditions:
1. Meniere's diseaseMeniere's disease is caused by excess fluid buildup in the inner ear, although the exact reason behind this fluid retention is not known. Along with the classic triad of symptoms—vertigo, ringing in the ears, and hearing loss -- some people with Meniere's disease report ear pain or pressure.2. Tumors
Although not common, a tumor may be the reason behind a person's ear pain. For example, nasopharyngeal cancer (a type of head and neck cancer) may cause ear fullness, along with hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and recurrent ear infections.Two examples of benign (noncancerous) tumors or growths that may develop in the ear and cause pain include:


Cholesteatoma: A benign skin growth that forms in the middle ear.


Acoustic neuroma: A benign inner ear tumor that develops on the vestibular nerve (eighth cranial nerve).


3. Other causes includeSome of the other causes of ear pain include:


Change in pressure, such as when flying on a plane


Temporomandibular joint (the joint that connects the lower jaw to the skull) syndrome 


Arthritis affecting the jaw


Eczema in the ear canal


Trigeminal neuralgia (chronic facial nerve pain)


Thyroid inflammation


Carotid artery pain (carotidynia) 


Learn more about the five most common causes of ear pain and how to deal with them.Read Here","Risk Factors For Ear Pain
The following conditions are related to increased risk of ear pain:


Inflammation in the ear


Fluid buildup in the ear


Medical conditions like respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, common cold, allergies or asthma


Illnesses that weaken the immune system such as AIDS (HIV infection)


Smoking also increases the chances of developing an ear infection


Children having viral infection


People who swim regularly are at a higher risk due to the water getting into the ears while swimming

","Prevention Of Ear Pain
Some ear pains may be preventable by avoiding some preventative measures like:


Avoid smoking


Avoid chronic use of cotton swabs  


Avoid putting sharp and foreign objects into the ear as this can scratch up the ear canal or the wax layer, which can increase the risk of infection


After swimming, blow-dry your ears to avoid buildup of water in the ear


Keeping swimming pools and hot tubs clean with disinfectants and regular pH testing will also reduce the risk of infection and ear pain


Breastfeed exclusively until your baby is 6 months old and continue to breastfeed for at least 12 months

","Treatment Of Ear Pain
 
As there are many different causes of ear pain, there are similarly many possible treatments. The treatment of choice will specifically depend on the root cause of your ear pain.
1. Self-care plan 
Home therapies can sometimes go a long way in easing ear pain, especially if the pain is related to fluid build-up from a virus or allergies.


Hold a warm compress against your ear or sinuses.


Performing simple jaw exercises in case of temporomandibular disorder (TMD).


For a blocked eustachian tube, drugs commonly used include decongestants and antihistamines can be used.


If a buildup of wax is causing your ear pain, you may be given wax-softening ear drops. They may cause the wax to fall out on its own.


In case of children, antibiotics cannot be prescribed immediately, watchful waiting and delayed prescribing steps are what doctors recommend. Watchful waiting for the child and waiting to check if the child needs antibiotics. This gives the immune system time to fight off the infection. 


2. Ear flushing 


This procedure is done to remove impacted wax, debris, infected material, and dead skin cells in the treatment of otitis externa (external ear).


If a buildup of wax is causing your ear pain, you may be given wax-softening ear drops, this causes the wax to soften. 


Ear lavage also known as ear irrigation or ear flush, is a safe method of earwax removal.


3. Medication 


Antibiotics are often not needed for middle ear infections because the body’s immune system can fight off the infection on its own. However, sometimes antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, are needed to treat severe cases right away or cases that last longer than 2–3 days. A standard 10-day course is recommended for younger children and children with severe illness; whereas a 5 to 7 day course is appropriate for children 6 and older with mild to moderate illness.


To soothe ear pain, sometimes the doctor may recommend over-the-counter acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such ibuprofen. This medication can help in getting relief in pain and fever.


For the pain of TMJ syndrome, your general practitioner may also prescribe a muscle relaxant or a tricyclic antidepressant.


Ear drops work in combination to reduce inflammation, treat the infection, and ease the pain. The drops contain active ingredients like acetic acid, benzocaine, benzocaine + chlorbutol + paradichlorobenzene + turpentine oil, and paradichlorobenzene + benzocaine + chlorbutol.


4. Surgery 
In a few cases, a surgical procedure called a myringotomy is sometimes needed to treat chronic middle ear infections which causes persistent ear pain in children and adults. The term myringotomy is a surgery where a tiny incision is made on the eardrum to drain out any fluid or pus that may have accumulated in the middle ear. Sometimes, an ear tube insertion is also placed, known as tympanostomy tubes or grommets, into the eardrum to reduce the occurrence of ear infections and allow drainage of excess fluids. The procedure is very common and poses minimal risks. An ear tube insertion is more common for children, who tend to suffer ear infections more often than adults.Surgery may also be indicated for other ear pain diagnoses like a tumor, severe mastoiditis, or abscess formation in perichondritis.",,,,,
Earwax,https://www.1mg.com/diseases/earwax-542,"Causes Of Earwax Buildup

Earwax is a sticky substance that is made up of dead skin cells, and sweat mixed with dirt, and contains oil. The sweat glands in the skin of the human external auditory canal, together with sebaceous glands, produce ear wax. It has lubricating and self-cleaning agents with protective, emollient, and bactericidal properties. 
Ear wax build-up can be due to:


Failure to self-clear because of slow skin migration


Putting small things like cotton buds, hairpins, headphones etc. in your ears. These objects can push the wax further down the ear canal.

","Types Of Earwax Buildup

Mostly everyone’s ears produce earwax. However, its composition varies from person to person.The 2 primary types of ear wax are wet and dry. Apart from these, here is a guide to different types of earwax:



Yellow and soft earwax: This type of ear wax is a sign of healthy ear wax production. It is soft in consistency. It is new wax and doesn’t harden too much before it falls out from the ear.





Pale and flaky earwax: It is also a sign of a self-cleaning mechanism of your ear. This type of wax easily falls out of the ear.





Brown and firm earwax: Brownish or darker color earwax is a sign of older and sometimes harder ear wax. This could be a sign of ear impaction.





Smelly ear wax: Smelly ear wax could be an early sign of any ear infection that might need a doctor’s intervention.





Liquid or runny earwax: It is a form of wet earwax that usually occurs after swimming or diving. However, sometimes it can occur due to other middle ear infections or ruptured eardrums. 





Blood-tinged earwax: If you find blood in your earwax, it's a sign of some injury to the ear canal.

Earwax acts as a natural barrier that prevents bacteria and dirt from entering the innermost parts of the ears. But, if it builds up, it can cause severe ear pain and infections by irritating your ears wall and preventing you from hearing well. Earwax build-up and blockage may cause the following symptoms:



Itchiness in the ear


A feeling of fullness in the ear


Foul odor or discharge from the ear


Earpain


Otalgia (ear infection with pain)


A sensation of air trapped in the ear or plugged


Tinnitus (ringing or noises in the ear)


Partial hearing loss or decreased hearing


Dizziness


Cough


Vertigo

Earwax blockage can be treated or removed in several ways. Most common methods include:
1. Irrigating or syringing with warm water
It is one of the most common processes used to clean earwax. Your doctor will fill a syringe with lukewarm water to rinse out the ear canal with water. In some cases, your doctor may use saline solution in place of warm water. Finally, your doctor can check and remove the remaining wax manually using special instruments such as spoons, forceps, or suction devices.
 
Note: Irrigation should not be performed if you have a history of ear surgery or anatomic abnormalities of the ear canal(birth defect).
 
2. Microsuction technique
Removal of impacted earwax requires an instrument for visualization such as an otoscope, headlamp, or binocular microscope, and for removal, a micro-suction device along with a thin long tube. During this procedure, your doctor fits a thin nozzle in your ear to vacuum out the wax by applying gentle pressure with the help of a suction pump. 

3. Medicines
Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs or topical solutions are present to clear earwax blockages. These preparations are also known as cerumenolytics (solutions to dissolve wax) and are commonly used are:



Hydrogen peroxide


Sodium bicarbonate 


Carbamide peroxide



You can use some natural cerumenolytic solutions in the ear canal. These solutions include:


Mineral oil


Baby oil


Glycerin


Saline solution



How to use the drops?
Put a few drops of solution into the ear with a dropper and lie down for at least 5 minutes. You may hear a bubbling sound inside your ear and it's normal. This is due to the foaming action of earwax removal. After a few minutes, lie on the opposite side so that the solution can rinse out of the ear canal containing wax in dissolved form. Clean the outer part of the ear with a small piece of cotton.

If excessive earwax is not removed, it may turn the symptoms of earwax blockage worse. Other complications include:


Perforated eardrum: A ruptured eardrum is a tear or hole in the thin tissue (tympanic membrane) that separates the outer ear from the middle ear. An untreated ruptured eardrum can cause severe pain due to infection. 



Note: A perforated eardrum can also be caused due to loud music, head injury, or any foreign entity in the ear.



Middle-ear infection: Some people develop an inflammation in the ear canal and later ear infection after irrigation. As earwax works as a physical barrier and prevents the entry of bugs, dirt, etc into the ear. Therefore, removing it completely can cause middle ear infections. Mostly mild ones are cleared up on their own but in some cases, ear drops(antibiotics) are needed to treat the infection.





External-ear infection (swimmer’s ear): This doesn’t mean that you are a regular swimmer. It occurs when moisture or water is trapped in the ear canal causing pain and a feeling of something being stuck inside the ear. This can be caused by taking showers, washing hair, or being in a moist or humid environment.

","Symptoms Of Ectopic pregnancy 

An ectopic pregnancy can first appear as a normal pregnancy. The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy can mimic miscarriage or the symptoms of other female reproductive disorders.
The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy can include:


Missed period, morning sickness, and breast tenderness


Pain in the lower abdomen


Pain in the lower back


Cramps on one side of the pelvis


Vaginal bleeding or spotting


Sudden and severe pain in the lower abdomen (if the fallopian tube ruptures).



The symptoms of normal pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy can be the same, especially in the early stages. To know more about the basics of pregnancyRead here","Causes Of Ectopic pregnancy

The fallopian tube has a carefully controlled environment that facilitates oocyte (egg cell) transport, fertilization, and migration of the early embryo to the uterus for implantation.
Any damage to the fallopian tubes can induce its dysfunction and thereby retention of an oocyte or embryo. 
Ectopic pregnancy can also occur in the cervix, ovaries, the muscle of the uterus, abdominal cavity, etc. discussed in detail in the next section.","Types of Ectopic pregnancy
 
The different types of ectopic pregnancy include:

Tubal ectopic pregnancy (in the fallopian tube)

- Either ampullary (in the middle part of the Fallopian tube), - Isthmic (in the upper part of the Fallopian tube close to the uterus) - Fimbrial (at the end of the tube)

Cesarean scar pregnancy (within a cesarean section scar on the uterus)
Cervical pregnancy (on the cervix)
Cornual pregnancy (within an abnormally shaped uterus)
Ovarian pregnancy (in or on the ovary)
Intramural pregnancy (in the muscle of the uterus)
Abdominal pregnancy (in the abdomen)
Heterotopic pregnancy (co-existence of an intrauterine pregnancy with an ectopic pregnancy)
","Risk Factors For Ectopic pregnancy
 
Up to 50 % of women diagnosed with EPs have no identifiable risk factors. However, the following risk factors have been associated with EP:


Age above 35 or older 


A history of ectopic pregnancy


Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) especially caused by Chlamydia Trachomatis infection 


A history of miscarriage


A history of repeated induced abortions


A history of infertility issues or medications to stimulate ovulation


Taking a progesterone-only oral contraceptive pill 


History of assisted reproductive technology (ART) such as in vitro fertilization(IVF).


Any abnormality in the shape of the Fallopian tube, such as a birth defect.


Any causes of pelvic adhesions, including endometriosis, and appendicitis, that may distort the shape of the fallopian tube


Prior abdominal surgeries such as a cesarean section


Past pelvic surgeries like tubal ligation (having your fallopian tubes’ tied or clamped to prevent pregnancy). 


An intrauterine device (IUD) in place at the time of conception


Other health conditions like genital tuberculosis

","Diagnosis Of Ectopic pregnancy

It can be difficult to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy from the symptoms alone, as they can be similar to other conditions. The steps that are often followed to diagnose an early ectopic pregnancy include:
1. Medical history and physical examination: Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms, and will examine your abdomen. The doctor will first confirm the pregnancy test.
With your consent, your doctor may also do a vaginal (internal) examination.
 
2. Blood tests: A test for the level of the pregnancy hormone βhCG (beta human chorionic
gonadotrophin) and progesterone level or a test every few days to examine for variations in the levels of these hormones, may help to make a diagnosis. 
These levels usually rise throughout normal pregnancy, but if they don't, it could be a symptom of an irregular pregnancy, such as an ectopic pregnancy or an approaching miscarriage.
If you are looking to book a test just sitting back at home, you are just a click away.Book Now!
 
3. Vaginal ultrasound: An ectopic pregnancy is usually diagnosed by doing a transvaginal ultrasound scan (in which a probe is softly put into your vagina). A transvaginal scan helps to identify the exact location of your pregnancy.
 
4. Laparoscopy: This is also called keyhole surgery. In some cases, laparoscopy is needed to confirm the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy. This procedure is also used in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy. 
It is done by using a small telescope to look at your pelvis by making a tiny cut, usually into the umbilicus (tummy button). 
Note: The combination of a urinary pregnancy test, transvaginal ultrasound, and serum hCG estimations is commonly used to enable the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent serious complications.","Prevention Of Ectopic pregnancy
 
In general, women cannot prevent Ectopic pregnancy (EP), however, the following points can help reduce the risk of EP: 
Here are certain steps that can help reduce the risk of ectopic pregnancy:
1. Use contraception: When having sex, use a condom. This can reduce your chances of developing pelvic inflammatory disease and sexually transmitted infections. 
Explore our wide range of contraceptive measures.Explore here
 
2. Get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs): Certain STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which raises the chance of ectopic pregnancy. Getting tested for STIs and treating any infections as soon as possible can help lower this risk.
 
3. Quit smoking: Smoking may raise your chances of developing EP. To lessen the risk, women should quit smoking or avoid being exposed to cigarette smoke before attempting to conceive.
Here we have an anti-smoking cessation range that will help you to stop your craving for smoking.Explore here
4. Get early prenatal care: If you do become pregnant, seeking early prenatal care can help ensure that any potential problems are detected and addressed as soon as possible. This can help lower the risk of complications, such as ectopic pregnancy.
 
5. Awareness about sex education: Women should receive their first ""sex education"" as young teenagers, which should cover the danger of infertility as a result of smoking, drug use, vaginal douching, and unsafe sex. During preconception counseling, the woman can be checked for ectopic pregnancy risk factors and told about the signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, as well as the need for early detection.","Specialist To Visit

Ectopic pregnancy may be treated in several ways. This depends on whether the fallopian tube has broken open (ruptured), how far along the pregnancy is, and your hormone levels. Treatments may include:
 
1. Medications
Your doctor may suggest a drug called methotrexate to halt the pregnancy if you are early in your pregnancy and there are no symptoms of internal bleeding.  By preventing cell growth, this medication puts an end to the pregnancy and does not require the removal of the fallopian tube.
It may sometimes require a follow-up injection or surgery. After the medicine is administered, doctors perform blood tests to detect hCG levels every week to determine whether methotrexate treatment was successful. 
If hCG cannot be detected, the treatment is considered effective. If methotrexate fails, a second dose or surgery is required. 
General precautions to be taken:


Women should limit their exposure to sunlight during treatment since methotrexate can promote sensitivity to sunlight and sunburn. 


Women who are taking methotrexate should avoid alcohol and folic acid (folate)-containing supplements. 


 
2. Surgery
An ectopic pregnancy can be removed from the fallopian tube by using two types of surgical procedures called salpingostomy and salpingectomy. These procedures can be performed by either Laparoscopy or Laparotomy.
 


Laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery: It is done to remove the fertilized egg from the fallopian tubes. The surgery may involve removing your damaged fallopian tube (salpingectomy) or opening your fallopian tube (salpingostomy) through a small lengthwise incision in the fallopian tube to remove the ectopic pregnancy tissue.




Laparotomy (open surgery): It is done to remove the ectopic pregnancy. If the pregnancy is advanced or there has been significant associated bleeding, then your doctor may perform a laparotomy, a type of surgery involving a much larger incision.


3. Expectant management
It is a conservative strategy that comprises persistent observation and monitoring of the situation to determine whether any treatment is required or whether the ectopic pregnancy resolves spontaneously and successfully without intervention. Patients are closely monitored with weekly transvaginal ultrasonography and b-hCG levels are measured in the blood.
 
4. Recovery after treatment
Following treatment, the doctor may advise the woman to undergo regular blood tests to ensure that her pregnancy hormone (hCG levels) return to zero. Otherwise, if your hormone level does not decrease or increase, you may require more treatment.
Most women heal quickly after laparoscopic surgery or a methotrexate injection and are able to leave the hospital within 24 hours.  
However, you must notify your doctor immediately if you have any of the following symptoms following treatment-
 

Feverish feeling or rise in body temperature
Swelling, redness, or pus accumulation on surgical cuts
Strong and foul-smelling vaginal discharge
Bright red vaginal blood loss or blood clots
","Home Care For Ectopic pregnancy

After treatment, it is important to follow your doctor's instructions for recovery and follow-up care. This may include-


Even if you feel better sooner, you should rest for a week after your surgery. Your body requires rest to heal.


Ask your family or friends to assist you with chores and errands while you recover.


Walk as often, if your body allows.




Perform deep breathing exercises.


Avoid strenuous activities.


Prevent constipation. To alleviate symptoms, it is recommended that you hydrate yourself, eat fruits and vegetables, drink plenty of water, and consume fiber-rich foods.  


If the pain gets severe, you can take painkillers after your doctor’s consultation. 



Follow-up care:


You may need follow-up blood tests to make sure that the ectopic pregnancy has been completely removed.


Keep a follow-up appointment with your doctor.


Immediately contact your doctor if you experience any unusual symptoms such as feverish, stomach ache, swelling on surgical wounds, vaginal discharge, nausea, etc.

","Complications Of Ectopic pregnancy
 
The complication of ectopic pregnancy may include-


Rupture of the fallopian tube: As the fertilized egg matures, it can burst the fallopian tube, resulting in serious bleeding and potentially life-threatening consequences. 

Infertility: Damage to a fallopian tube following an ectopic pregnancy can result in scarring and obstructions, making it harder to conceive in the future.In this case, talk to your doctor about other options to get pregnant, like IVF (in vitro fertilization).

Hypovolemic shock: Severe internal bleeding can result in shock, a potentially fatal condition that requires prompt medical intervention.

","Causes Of Eczema
The exact cause of eczema is not fully known. However, there are a few theories or hypotheses regarding the underlying causes of eczema. These are not thought to be mutually exclusive and may complement each other to cause eczema.
1. Defects in skin barrier
The cells that make up our skin are vital for optimal skin hydration. People with eczema tend to have dry skin due to a defect in their skin barrier.A strong association has been found between eczema and genetic change or mutation in the filaggrin gene (FLG). It is a vital gene which is responsible for creating the tough cells that make the outermost protective layer of the skin. In a patient with normal skin cells, these cells are tightly packed in an organized manner. With gene defects, less filaggrin is produced, leading to a haphazard organization of these skin cells.This dysfunction causes a 'leaky' skin barrier. Water can easily escape from this leaky skin leading to dryness and dehydration. Harmful substances or allergens can more readily penetrate the skin leading to infections. 
2. Impaired defense mechanisms
People with eczema have also been found to have decreased numbers of beta-defensins in the skin. Beta-defensins are proteins that are important for fighting off certain bacteria, viruses, and fungi. A decrease in Beta-defensins leads to increased susceptibility to skin infections.
3.  Immunological causes
The immune system develops in the first six months of life. There is usually an equilibrium between the two main types of T helper lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) namely Th-1 and Th-2. In eczema, this balance is disrupted with excess Th-2 cells and their associated chemical messengers (cytokines). In some kids, high levels of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and eosinophils (the white blood cells associated with allergy) are also found.In rare cases, a single mutation in CARD11, a gene involved in the development and function of certain immune system cells, can cause eczema.","Symptoms Of Eczema
The skin of people with eczema does not retain moisture well and loses its protective properties. When this occurs, various symptoms can develop according to the phase of the disease.In the acute phase, lesions are intensely red, bumpy patches or plaques that may ooze fluid when scratched.In the chronic phase, scratching and rubbing create skin lesions that appear scaly, dry, thicker, darker, scarred or lichenified. Cracking of the skin or fissures can also occur.Other common symptoms associated with eczema are:


Intense itching


Swollen skin


Dry skin (xerosis) 


Skin color changes 


Pus discharge due to secondary infection


Rash


Hives


Increased lines on the palms of the hands and feet


Dry, pale patches on the face and upper arms


Small bumps on the upper arms and thighs


Double skinfold underneath the inferior eyelid (Dennie-Morgan fold)


Note: Distribution of lesions is age specific.


Infants younger than 1 year old usually have the eczema rash on their cheeks, forehead, eyelids or scalp. It may spread to the knees, elbows, and trunk (but not usually the diaper area).


Older children and adults usually get the rash in the flexural surfaces or bends of the elbows, behind the knees, on the neck, or on the inner wrists and ankles. 

","Risk Factors For Eczema

Eczema results from a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. 
Genetics
If a parent has atopic eczema, then the child could develop it, too. And, if both the parents have it, then there is a greater risk. Apart from this, if there is a family history of allergies, asthma or hay fever, then, too, there is a greater risk of the child developing eczema.
Personal history
Individuals with a personal history of allergies, hay fever or asthma have more chances of suffering from eczema.Eczema, asthma, and hay fever are known as ""atopic"" conditions. These affect people who are overly sensitive to allergens in the environment. 
Environmental factors
The irritants in our environment that can trigger eczema include:


Harsh soaps


Shampoos


Detergents and household cleaners


Dishwashing soaps and liquids


Perfumes


Disinfectants

Glues and adhesives

Chemicals used in dyes and tattoos


Antibacterial ointments


Fabrics like wool and polyester


Pollens


Molds


Mites 


Animal dander


Tobacco smoke


Stress
Surprisingly, stress could also be one of the causes of eczema. Likewise, eczema causes excess stress. Mental, emotional, and physical stress that may trigger eczema are:


Depression


Anxiety


Inability to sleep


Irritability


Here's everything you need to understand about stress and its effects on your body.Click To Read!Studies suggest some more risk factors for developing eczema. These are:


Food allergies such as allergy to cow’s milk, hen’s eggs, and peanuts


Being sensitized to food in infancy


Cold climate


Exposure to secondhand smoke


Excess weight at birth


Treatment with antibiotics in infancy


Exposure to hard water in infancy


Birth through cesarean section

","Diagnosis Of Eczema
An accurate diagnosis requires a physical examination of the entire skin surface along with a detailed medical and family history. If any family members have atopic conditions, it is an important clue. No specific investigations are required to diagnose eczema. However, when there is a doubt or to confirm diagnosis, the following tests can be performed. 
1. Patch test
A patch test is carried out to detect allergens. This helps your doctor to plan the right treatment for the allergies. They will also create a plan of action to tackle the dryness and itchiness of the skin and bring your symptoms under control. Patch test is essential particularly if the dermatitis becomes resistant to treatment.
2. Blood tests
Blood tests might be performed to check for causes of rashes that may be unrelated to dermatitis.
3. Skin biopsy 
Skin biopsy can be done to distinguish one type of dermatitis from the other.Read more about allergies and ways to tackle them.Click Here!","Prevention Of Eczema
Eczema is a skin condition that develops as a result of an overactive immune system, a family history, or allergens and irritants in our environment. It has no permanent cure nor it can be prevented. However, we can definitely prevent the flares if we are aware of the triggers. Some of the triggers and tips to prevent it includes:
1. Dry skin

Dry skin is the most common symptom of eczema. Weather changes, harsh soaps and hot water can all cause our skin to dry. So, the best way to ensure soft skin is to look after our skin health. Here are a few tips to prevent dry skin.


Apply body lotion, moisturizer or emollient, or cold-pressed coconut oil after a shower to lock in the moisture. Moisturize at bedtime, too. Ceramide containing creams are particularly useful.


Place a humidifier in your bedroom during winters to moisten the air and ensure a good night’s sleep.


Avoid long, hot water showers during winters as the skin is sensitive to temperature changes. Allow the body to warm up before a shower. Add a few drops of body oils to your bath.


Avoid using harsh soaps, body washes, and shampoos. Avoid using cosmetics, perfumes, or toiletries that are loaded with chemicals and can trigger a skin infection.

2. Irritants and allergens
The everyday products we use contain irritants that trigger rashes on our skin. The foods that we eat cause flare-ups, too. Here are some of the common products and food items that trigger a flare-up. You can find ways to replace them with products that are gentle on the skin and foods that provide the necessary nutrients without disturbing the immune system.Some of the common products that contain irritants include:


Detergents


Handwashes


Baby wipes


Fragrances


Glues and adhesives


Skincare products


Wools and polyester fabrics


Foods that may cause allergies are:


Milk


Eggs


Nuts


Gluten (wheat)


Spices


Citrus fruits


Tomatoes


Allergens are also hidden in unexpected places such as pet dander, dust mites, cockroaches, pollen, and mold. Avoiding these may prevent skin allergies leading to eczema.
3. Stress and anxiety
Our mental health and well-being affect our physical health and lifestyle. Stress and worry cause a flare-up and skin infections can cause stress and anxiety. Finding ways to get out of this vicious circle will help you manage the triggers and prevent eczema flare-ups. Sufficient sleep, a gentle workout that does not cause sweating, and meditation will help you stay calm and deal with the triggers. You could ask your doctor for therapists who will help ease your tension.","Treatment Of Eczema
Eczema is a skin condition where patches on the skin become dry, itchy, and inflamed. It does not have a diagnostic test. However, its symptoms can be treated if you are well aware of the triggers that cause flares. Here are some of the medications that are prescribed by doctors for the treatment of the symptoms of eczema.
A. Medical management
1. Corticosteroid creams and lotions: Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medicines that give relief from inflammation and itchiness. Some may require prescriptions. Most commonly used corticosteroids are:


Prednisolone


Hydrocortisone


2. Topical calcineurin inhibitors: Calcineurin inhibitors help reduce inflammation and prevent flares. Examples include:


Tacrolimus 


Pimecrolimus


3. Barrier repair moisturizers: Barrier repair moisturizers repair the skin by reducing water loss. These are moisturizers that repair the natural moisture barriers of the skin and enable faster healing and hydration of the skin.4. Antihistamines: They are medicines used to treat allergic skin reactions, hay fever, and allergic conditions. These cause drowsiness and hence reduce nighttime scratching to ensure a goodnight’s sleep. 5. Antibiotics: These are prescribed for bacterial infections that might develop along with eczema. These include:


Flucloxacilli


Erythromycin 


Penicillin


6. Other medications: Ciclosporin is prescribed if topical treatments aren’t reducing the symptoms. These medications should be taken as per doctor’s prescriptions and for a short period.
B. Injected biologic drugs
These drugs work by blocking the proteins in the immune system. This calms the immune system and results in less severe inflammation and fewer symptoms. These include:


Rituximab


Omalizumab


Dupliximab


Infliximab


Mepolizumab


Tocilizumab 


C. Phototherapy
This therapy is used for eczema that is spread all over the body. In this therapy, the skin is exposed to UVA and UVB waves to treat moderate dermatitis. It needs a month or two of steady treatment to notice any improvement in the symptoms.","Home-care For Eczema
Changing your lifestyle and eliminating products and food items that trigger flare-ups are the two most important things you can do to take care of your health. It is easier to prevent flare-ups but difficult to cure them permanently. So, making a gradual change instead of a quick transition will help you eventually. Here are some changes you can make at home to help prevent skin rashes or skin infections. 


Moisturize every day: Choose gentle body lotions and moisturizers or emollients to moisturize the skin. Ceramide containing creams are more effective in management of eczema.


Add household bleach to your bath water: This helps kill the bacteria that cause the infections in eczema. It will also ease the inflammation and the itching. Add half a cup of bleach to a tub of water and soak in it for 10 minutes. Rinse well. 


Be gentle while drying the skin: Dab dry with the towel to wipe away the moisture. Do not scrub. 


Use mild soaps and body wash: Eliminate all the harsh soaps, shampoos, and body wash and replace them with products that are gentle on the skin and prevent it from drying. 


Try cool compress: Apply a cool compress to ease the itching. A clean, damp cloth will give you relief from the itching. Avoid scratching.


Say no to hot water showers: Switch to lukewarm showers during winters. Have shorter baths and pat dry the skin. Moisturize after the shower.


Use cold-pressed coconut oil: Coconut oil is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. It helps soften dry skin and heals bacterial infections of the skin. 


Try vitamin supplements: Enquire about vitamin supplements such as fish oil capsules, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, zinc, selenium, probiotics, and turmeric supplements. These might be beneficial in dealing with skin infections.


Avoid fabrics that irritate the skin: Switch to cotton, silk, and linen clothes. These are skin-friendly fabrics and will not cause any skin allergies.


Avoid high-intensity workouts: Try a gentle exercise regimen that will prevent sweating and skin rashes. 


Massage your body: A body massage with the right oils or lotions will make you feel better. Look for a masseur who is experienced in giving body massages to patients with eczema. 


Manage mental stress: Try gentle yoga exercises and meditation for relief from stress and anxiety. Flare-ups can trigger anxiety which is not good for health.

The main reason behind the several complications of eczema is itching. The skin gets damaged by the incessant scratching due to itchiness. This results in various infections that can worsen the condition. 
Cellulitis
It is a bacterial infection where the bacteria infects the deeper layers of the skin. The skin is red, swollen, and very painful. It spreads rapidly and affects the lower legs, face, arms, and other areas. The bacteria enter the skin through a crack and spread infection. The swelling is followed by pain, blisters, and fever. If left untreated, it can be life-threatening. 
Eczema herpeticum
 This viral infection is caused by the virus that causes herpes. The symptoms are painful blisters, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. 
Molluscum contagiosum
This infection is caused by a poxvirus. It causes white wounds on the skin that itch and swell. Curettage (cutting it) or cryotherapy (freezing it) are some of the ways of treating this viral infection.
Neurodermatitis
Itching and scratching of the skin because of eczema causes this infection. Continuous scratching causes the skin to become thick and dry. It can happen on the ankles, neck, hands, elbows, feet, shoulders, wrists, and scalp. Steroids are prescribed for its treatment along with medicines to help you sleep better and prevent scratching. 
Scars
The constant itching and scratching because of the infection leads to scarring of the skin. Once dry, the scars fade away with time.
Seborrheic dermatitis
It is a type of eczema that affects the scalp. It is caused by a fungus called Malassezia yeast that is found on the surface of the skin. It causes severe dandruff, itching, and hair loss due to damaged hair follicles. It affects the forehead, nose, armpits, chest, and groin. 
Sleeplessness
Eczema severely affects a person’s sleep. The itchiness seems worse at night and leads to scratching and discomfort. Staying away from the triggers and getting treated for the itching can help in better sleep. 
Depression and anxiety
Eczema increases stress and anxiety because of skin rashes and itching. Likewise, stress and depression can trigger flare-ups. A support group and therapy will help you relax and find ways to tackle the flare-ups. ","Alternative Therpaies For Eczema

","Types Of Edema
The various types of edema include:1. Peripheral edema: Edema of peripheral parts like legs, feet, and ankles.2. Pedal edema: Edema of the foot.3. Pulmonary edema: This is characterized by the accumulation of fluids in air spaces of the lungs that may lead to respiratory failure.4. Cerebral edema: The accumulation of increased water content in the brain that may be caused due to ischemic stroke, cancer, or brain inflammation due to meningitis or encephalitis.5. Angioedema: It generally occurs on the face and is different from hives where swelling is caused underneath the skin rather than on the surface of the skin.6. Hereditary angioedema: It is a rare genetic condition that affects the immune system.  This type of swelling generally affects the face, genitals, and abdomen.7. Papilledema: Swelling of the optic nerve of the eye which is a result of increased intracranial pressure inside the skull and around the brain.8. Macular edema: This condition occurs when blood vessels leak into a part of the retina called the macula, making it swell.9. Dependent edema: It is the swelling that occurs in the legs and lower body which is affected by gravity and position.10. Scrotal lymphedema: It is caused due to enlargement of the scrotum due to fluid accumulation around the testes.11. Lipedema: It is a disorder of the fatty (adipose) tissue that causes swelling of the legs and hips.12. Ascites: It is a condition in which fluid collects in spaces within the abdomen.13. Pleural effusion: It is an abnormal, excessive collection of this fluid in the chest (lung or pleural cavity). The most common cause of the pleural effusion is heart failure.14. Anasarca: This is a medical condition that leads to general swelling of the entire body.The condition is also known as extreme generalized edema or massive edema.15. Idiopathic edema: Accumulation of fluid in tissues with no particular cause.Edema can also be broadly classified as:1. Pitting edema: In this condition, depression is seen when pressure is applied to the skin and removed.2. Non-pitting edema: This is a type of edema in which there is no presence of depression when pressure is applied. ","Symptoms Of Edema
 

Some of the common signs and symptoms of edema include:
1. Swelling
Swelling in edema is due to fluid retention in the tissues. Swelling affects the feet, ankles, and legs the most, but it can also affect other parts such as the face, hands, and abdomen. 
2. Stretched and shiny skin
In edema, the skin above the swelling area may appear stretched and glossy. The stretching of the skin is due to excess fluid that pulls the skin. 
3. Pitting
Poor circulation or the retention of extra fluids are the most common causes of pitting edema. A dimple in the skin can be created by gently pressing in on the swelling area with the finger for at least 5 seconds and then removing your finger.
4. Aching body parts
The aching pain can be local or general. It depends upon the underlying cause of edema. Excess fluid and disturbed cellular activities are the cause of pain in edema. 
5. Weight gain
Unexplained weight gain could be due to fluid retention. Weight gain can make limbs, hands, feet, face, or abdomen appear puffy. 
6. Decreased urine output
If kidney disease is the underlying cause of edema, urine output could get affected. The kidneys are vital organs that help in blood purification. During this process, the excess fluid along with toxins and waste is eliminated in the form of urine. In kidney disorders, the kidney fails to produce urine in adequate quantities and, as a result, edema develops. 
7. Shortness of breath
Is because of the lung's inability to provide enough oxygen to the body. Shortness of breath also known as dyspnea develops gradually.
8. Chest pain 
Another symptom of pulmonary edema. If the underlying cause of pulmonary edema is a cardiac disease or chest injury it may present with severe chest pain. Chest pain is not something to ignore! It can be life-threatening and may need immediate attention. Read about first-aid tips to follow in case of chest pain.Tap Now!
 ","Causes Of Edema
 
When the small blood arteries (capillaries) leak fluid and fluid collects in the surrounding tissues, it leads to edema.It could be due to a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection. This may be beneficial in some instances, such as an infection. More fluid from your blood vessels fills the enlarged area with infection-fighting white blood cells.However, edema could also indicate serious underlying medical conditions including:
1. Congestive heart failure
One or both the lower chambers of the heart lose their capacity to pump blood effectively in congestive heart failure. Blood can back up in the legs, ankles, and feet as a result, creating edema.This disorder can sometimes cause fluid to build up in the lungs (pulmonary edema), resulting in shortness of breath.Worried about your heart health? Read 5 tips by cardiologists to keep your heart healthy.Click Here!
2. Liver cirrhosis 
Ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity) and fluid accumulation in the legs can occur as a result of liver injury (cirrhosis).
3. Kidney disease 
Edema can also be caused due to kidney or renal disease. Kidney disease may lead to fluid and sodium retention in the body, causing the legs to swell.
4. Damage to veins in the legs 
The one-way valves in the leg veins are weakened or destroyed allowing blood to pool and produce swelling. A blood clot (deep vein thrombosis, or DVT) in one of the leg veins can cause sudden swelling in one leg, as well as pain in the calf muscle. In this condition, one must get medical attention immediately.
5. Inadequate lymphatic system
The lymphatic system aids in the removal of excess fluid from tissues. If this system gets affected, like in cancer surgery, the lymph nodes and lymph arteries that drain an area may not function properly, resulting in edema.
6. Protein deficiency 
Albumin and other proteins in the blood behave like sponges, allowing fluid to flow freely through your blood vessels. Over time, a deficiency of protein in the diet might result in fluid accumulation and edema. However, it is rarely the cause.
7. Allergic reactions 
Edema is a common side effect of allergic responses. Nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area in response to the allergen.
8. Head trauma
Cerebral edema can be due to low blood sodium, high altitudes, brain tumors, and a block in fluid outflow in the brain (hydrocephalus). Headache, disorientation, and unconsciousness are all possible symptoms.
9. Critical illness
Burns, life-threatening infections, and other conditions can trigger a response that permits fluid to leak into practically all tissues. This can result in edema all over the body.
10. Emphysema
It is a lung condition that can also cause edema in the legs and feet if the pressure in the lungs and heart gets elevated.","Risk Factors For Edema
 
Numerous factors can up your risk of edema. They include:1. Pregnancy: The fetus and placenta require more fluid, hence the body retains more sodium and water, making one more susceptible to edema.2. Taking certain medicines: The following medicines increase the risk of edema:


Blood-pressure lowering medications


Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) 


Estrogens


Thiazolidinediones (oral antidiabetic medicine)


Corticosteroids (like prednisone and methylprednisolone)


3. Prolonged sitting or standing: This can cause edema, especially in hot weather, leading to excess fluid accumulating in the feet, ankles, and lower legs. 4. Excessive sodium consumption: Consuming too much salt (sodium) can cause swelling on the fingers and around the ankles due to excessive fluid build-up in the body's tissues.5. Obesity: Several studies have demonstrated an increased body mass index is widely acknowledged as a risk factor involved in the development of edema.6. Uncontrolled diabetes: Diabetes can affect your blood circulation and cause fluid to build up in the lower extremities. Persons with diabetes frequently present with lower extremity (LE) edema. 7. Premenstrual hormonal changes: Edema is seen in 92% of women, predominantly in the second phase of the menstrual cycle due to the hormone progesterone that causes water retention.
 ","Diagnosis Of Edema
 
If you experience any symptoms of edema such as swelling or puffiness, stretched skin, weight gain, or a change in urine output, then it is wise to consult a doctor. Your doctor might do a physical examination and ask you a few questions related to your medical history. Physical examination generally includes inspecting the skin over the swollen area. The doctor may also press gently over the swollen part for about 15 - 20 seconds to see if it leaves a dimple. The doctor might ask for some more tests to diagnose the cause:1. X-ray of the chest: A chest X-ray can help confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary edema and rule out other causes of shortness of breath.2. Urine routine microscopy: Urine sample is analyzed to check for the presence of protein in urine. Proteins are reabsorbed and not eliminated in the urine. In kidney diseases, the kidneys fail to function properly, and as a result, protein and albumin are excreted in the urine. At the same time, the fluid having toxins is retained, which gets accumulated and gives rise to edema. 3. Ultrasound: It is a test that helps to check the distribution of edema. The intensity and spread of edema can be determined by ultrasound.4. Echocardiography (ECG): This test can be used to determine any cardiac causes of edema.5. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): The test can help identify any damage in the bone marrow that may result in the development of edema.6. Blood test: A complete blood count (CBC) along with kidney function test, lipid profile, and liver function test is useful in diagnosing causes of edema. In some cases, allergic tests, tests for viral or bacterial infection, or toxicity tests are recommended. Additional serological tests could be done based on the condition.Get your lab tests done with us, where patient comfort and safety are the utmost priority.Book Now!","Prevention Of Edema
Here are a few simple tips that can help you to manage and prevent edema:
1. Physical activity
Try to be physically active. Sitting or standing for long periods without moving is not recommended.Moving helps in activating the muscles in the affected body area, particularly the legs. This may assist in pumping the excess fluid back to the heart. While traveling, get up and stroll about, especially if you are flying.Read about 5 marvelous ways in which walking can benefit your health. Read Now!
2. Eat a low sodium diet
Avoid consuming too much sodium in your diet. A low-salt diet helps to regulate high blood pressure and edema. 
3. Elevate your legs
Raising the legs above heart level for 30 minutes three or four times a day can help with leg, ankle, and foot edema. For those with minor venous illnesses, elevating the legs may be enough to eliminate edema.
4. Drinking water 
Although fluid retention causes swelling, drinking water can help to lessen edema. To minimize swelling, drink 8-10 glasses of water every day. When the body is dehydrated, it maintains the fluids it already has. This results in edema.
5. Avoid alcohol
Avoid consuming alcoholic beverages. If drinking alcohol produces recurring swelling, it could indicate a problem with the kidneys, liver, or heart.
6. Magnesium-rich foods 
Magnesium deficiency leads to retention of water in the body. Eating magnesium-rich foods like Tofu, spinach, cashews, almonds, dark chocolate, broccoli, and avocados are helpful in preventing edema.Do you want to buy magnesium supplements?

","Symptoms Of Fainting
Fainting (Syncope) can occur suddenly and with or without any preceding signs or symptoms. Some of the symptoms that start prior to syncope may include:


Dizziness


Lightheadedness


Nausea


Visual disturbances


Cold clammy skin


Sweating


Weakness


Decreased heart rate


Low blood pressure


Headache


Yawning


Blackouts

",,"Causes Of Fainting
The brain requires blood flow to provide oxygen and glucose to its cells to sustain life. Fainting is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain because of the following reasons or a combination of them:


The heart fails to pump the blood.


The blood vessels lack enough tone to maintain adequate blood pressure to deliver the blood to the brain.


There is not enough blood or fluid in the blood vessels.


Some of the most common types of syncope and their causes are discussed below:
1. Vasovagal syncope
It is the most common type of syncope caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure, which causes a drop in blood flow to the brain. The most common triggers for vasovagal syncope include:


Prolonged standing


Fear of injury


Physical or psychological stress


Dehydration


Bleeding


Pain


Strain


Heat exposure


Sight of blood


When an individual stands, gravity causes blood to settle in the lower part of the body, leading to syncope. In some cases of physical trauma, the body lowers blood pressure and heart rate to reduce the amount of bleeding, which causes syncope.
2. Situational syncope
Situational syncope occurs when a specific situation act as the trigger for a syncopal episode such as:


Urination


Defecation


Forceful coughing


Sneezing


Swallowing


Post-exercise


Dehydration


Intense emotional stress


Anxiety


Fear


Pain


Hunger


Use of alcohol or drugs


Breathing in too much oxygen and getting rid of too much carbon dioxide too quickly.


3. Cardiogenic syncope
Various heart conditions can cause fainting. These include:


Heart beating too fast or too slow


Abnormalities of the heart valves


Widespread disease of the heart muscle 


Blockage of blood flow from the heart

4. Orthostatic hypotension syncope
It is a transient loss of consciousness due to reduced blood flow to the brain due to the following reasons:


Volume depletion: Inadequate fluid intake (hot weather), diarrhea, vomiting, etc.


Drug-induced orthostatic hypotension: Alcohol, vasodilators, diuretics, and beta-adrenergic blockers


Diseases of the nervous system: These include Parkinson’s disease(a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system causing tremors in the body), Lewy body dementia (a disease associated with abnormal deposits of a protein leading to forgetfulness), diabetes, amyloidosis (build-up of proteins called amyloids in the organs), and spinal cord injuries.


April 11th is observed as World Parkinson’s Day every year. The aim is to raise awareness about the condition. To know more about parkinson’s disease.Click Here!
5. Neurologic syncope
It is caused by neurological conditions like:


Seizure


Stroke


Migraine



Abnormal build-up of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain.

6. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
It is caused by a very fast heart rate (tachycardia) that happens when a person stands after sitting or lying down. Usually when a person stands, the nerves send signals to the blood vessels in the lower body to tighten. The tightening vessels work against gravity to keep blood from collecting in the legs. If there is not enough blood flow to the brain, a person may feel lightheaded or pass out every time they stand.This condition is most common in women, but it can occur in men as well.
7. Other causes
The lesser common causes of syncope include:


Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)


Hypoxia (decreased oxygen)


Symptomatic anemia


Tumor in the heart


Panic attacks

","Risk Factors For Fainting

Fainting (Syncope) is common in older adults, but younger people without cardiac disease may experience syncope while standing or have specific stress or situational triggers.Risk factors include:


Age >65 years


Male gender


Structural heart disease


Heart failure


Family history of fainting or cardiac conditions


Syncope-related trauma


Hypertension


Palpitation


Abnormal ECG


High levels of troponin in the blood (an indicator of recent heart attack)

Recurrent syncope has effects on quality of life and the degree of impairment is proportional to syncope frequency. Some things to keep in mind to prevent the next syncopal episode include:
1. Eat right
Eat regular meals and do not skip meals as low blood sugar levels can also cause syncope. Increase your salt intake as it expands your blood volume by retaining fluids preventing a drop in your blood pressure.
2. Know your triggers
Having an understanding of what causes syncope for you and then avoiding it can help prevent future episodes. Talk to your doctor to understand the cause of your episodes and take all your medications on time as prescribed by the doctor.
3. Manage presyncope symptoms
Lie down when you feel the symptoms of syncope starting and do not exert yourself too much. Do not exert yourself too much and if you stand in a place for a long time make sure to keep moving your legs. You can also try simple exercises to raise blood pressure like leg crossing, squatting, and tensing of legs and buttocks.
4. Use compression stockings
By exerting pressure against the legs, compression stockings reduce the diameter of the veins and increase blood flow in the legs.
5. Stay hydrated
Dehydration can be one of the most important yet neglected causes of syncope. Dink at least 2 liters of water a day to keep yourself wee-hydrated.
6. Avoid long and hot showers
Heat causes blood to shift to the superficial tissues and hot water dilates blood vessels, thus, dropping the blood pressure.
7. Cope up with your anxiety
If you have anxiety make sure to calm down to prevent syncope. Find ways of managing your anxiety with meditation, yoga, or exercise.

Treatment of the underlying cause is the focus of treatment in fainting. During an acute episode, patients should be made to sit or lay down quickly, and raising the legs help recovery. Treatment of any injuries sustained during a sudden fall from syncope should be given immediate attention. Treatment options depending on types of syncope include:
1. Vasovagal syncope
Conservative measures include avoiding situations or stimuli that have caused them, increasing the use of salt and fluid, and making lifestyle modifications. Other modalities include:


Drug therapy: Many agents have been prescribed for vasovagal syncope that might be useful if conservative measures fail, there include:


Beta-blockers


Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors


Hydro fludrocortisone


Proamatine


Fludrocortisone


Alpha Agonists






Tilt Training: This consists of long periods of upright posture and has been recommended in patients who have high symptoms of syncope. Long-term benefit has yet to be demonstrated with attrition of compliance with the rule.




Device Therapy: On the basis of limited yet compelling randomized, controlled trial data, permanent pacing is indicated in carotid sinus syndrome, and this response clinically manifests as syncope.


2. Orthostatic hypotension
The treatment for this type of syncope is generally conservative consisting of:


Rising slowly from sleeping and sitting position


Avoiding medications like diuretics, and vasodilators


Use of compression stocking to improve blood circulation


Intravenous fluids in patients who are dehydrated


Using protamine in unmanageable cases.


3. Cardiac syncope 
Treating underlying conditions is the goal of this kind of syncope. Patients with syncope and underlying heart disease need regular follow-ups with their physician and cardiologist.
The goals of treatment are to reduce mortality, injury, and recurrences. Treatment is obviously best directed at the correction of the underlying cause when this is possible.

","Types Of Fatty Liver Disease
 
Fatty liver disease is broadly categorized into 2 types. These are:
1. Alcohol-related fatty liver disease (AFLD)
Alcoholic fatty liver disease occurs due to the consumption of alcohol in excessive amounts. 

2. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not related to alcohol consumption. We will be focusing on this type in detail. 
NAFLD is further classified as:


 Fatty liver (isolated fatty liver or IFL) 


 Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)


In both isolated fatty liver and NASH there is a high amount of fat in the liver cells, but, in addition, in NASH there is inflammation within the liver, and, as a result, the liver cells are damaged and are replaced by scar tissue.","Symptoms Of Fatty Liver Disease
Fatty liver disease can progress through four stages, which include:


Simple fatty liver: It refers to the deposition and buildup of excess fat in the liver. It is usually harmless if it doesn’t progress.


Steatohepatitis: This refers to when there is inflammation in the liver along with fat deposition.


Fibrosis: This stage occurs when constant inflammation in the liver begins causing scarring. However, the liver can still function normally.


Cirrhosis: In this stage, scarring of the liver has become widespread, weakening the liver’s ability to function. This is a serious stage and is irreversible.


With NAFLD there are usually no symptoms in the early stages. However, in a few cases, the patient may feel tired and have discomfort in the upper right side of the abdomen. In cirrhosis (latter stages of NAFLD), the following symptoms can be observed:


Weakness or fatigue


Swollen belly


Abdominal pain


Loss of appetite


Weight loss


Confusion


Enlarged blood vessels underneath your skin


Larger than normal breasts in men


Edema (swelling), especially in the legs


Fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites)


Skin and eyes appear yellow due to jaundice


Dark-colored urine


Pale stools

",,"Risk Factors For Fatty Liver Disease
NAFLD is primarily caused by the deposition of fats in the liver and the various risk factors include:
1. Diet and dietary habits
High frequency of eating fast foods, and larger food portions that contain high saturated fats and refined carbohydrates can increase the risk of NAFLD. 
Dietary habits like inappropriate mealtimes, including the habit of eating too much at evening and night, missing breakfast, and eating too rapidly also predispose to insulin resistance and thereby NAFLD.

2. Overweight or obesity

Obesity is a strong risk factor for NAFLD. According to a study, up to 75% of people who are overweight and 90% of people who are obese are suffering from NAFLD.

3. High BMI

Another study suggests that adults with a high BMI (Body mass index is a measure of body fat based on the height and weight of an adult) rate may have a risk of NAFLD.

4. Age

The risk of developing NAFLD increases with age because older people begin experiencing organ dysfunction. A relatively high proportion of individuals with progressive forms of NAFLD develop cirrhosis by the time they are in their 70s or beyond.

5. Family history

Research shows that liver fat fraction and fatty liver condition are inherited traits and tend to run in families.

6. Type 2 diabetes
Diabetes significantly raises the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In most cases, Type 2 diabetes mellitus and NAFLD exist together.

7. High cholesterol
Dyslipidemia, i.e. high levels of triglycerides and LDL (bad cholesterol) or low levels of HDL (good cholesterol) in the blood can predispose to NAFLD.

8. Metabolic syndrome 

Metabolic syndrome is a combination of risk factors which predispose a person to developing type Ⅱ diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
The current diagnostic criteria require having 3 of 5 of the following factors: 


Triglycerides (150 mg/dL or greater)


HDL cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL in men and less than 50 mg/dL in women)


High fasting glucose (100 g/dL or greater) 


Increased waist circumference (defined by population specific data)


High blood pressure (greater than 130/85 mmHg) 



It is observed that the incidence of NAFLD has been increasing in concert with the rising rates of metabolic syndrome. 

9. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
The prevalence of NAFLD is higher in women suffering from PCOS. PCOS puts women at increased risk of insulin resistance, a critical factor in liver damage. 

10. Obstructive sleep apnea

Evidence shows that obstructive sleep apnea can induce non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by increasing insulin resistance, inflammation, and dyslipidemia. 

11. Hepatitis infections
HBV and HCV (hepatitis B and C viruses respectively) affect millions of people globally and are a major cause of chronic liver disease, including NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).

12. Genetic conditions

Defective LIPA gene which is clinically known as Wolman’s disease and cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD) can lead to chronic liver diseases. Fibrosis leading to cirrhosis is seen in two-thirds of patients with LIPA deficiency.

13. Certain medications
Side effects of certain medicines, such as corticosteroids, antidepressants, and antipsychotics can induce fatty liver disease.

14. Smoking

Smoking predisposes to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, which are significant risk factors for fatty liver disease.

2. Exercise Regime
120 minutes of aerobic exercise, such as running and swimming every week, increases glucose uptake by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing hepatic fat content.
 
NAFLD is also improved with resistance exercises, which may be more tolerable for patients who suffer from poor cardiorespiratory fitness and cannot tolerate intense aerobic workouts.
 
A study has also shown that modified high-intensity interval training (HIIT) of five cycles of high-intensity cycling followed by 3-min recovery periods, three times/week for 12 weeks, leads to a reduction in liver fat.
 
However it is important that an individualized exercise be developed based on


The severity of underlying liver dysfunction from NAFLD


Class of obesity


Exercise tolerance status


Presence of individual components of metabolic syndrome and other comorbid medical problems


 
3. Weight loss using medications
While weight can be mostly managed by caloric restriction from dietary modifications and physical exercise, medications like Orlistat can aid in moderate weight loss by reducing the absorption of fat.
 
4. Bariatric surgery
Sometimes, exercise and diet modifications fail to lose weight in excessively obese people. It increases insulin sensitivity in the liver, muscles, and fat along with improving overall metabolic health.

5. Dietary supplements
Certain vitamin supplements can give a helping hand in managing fatty liver disease. These include:



Vitamin E: It reduces triglycerides as well as oxidative stress, which contributes to decreasing the progression of fatty liver in patients.

Pioglitazone




 

7. Liver transplantation 
In advanced cases of fatty liver disease, when the liver completely loses its ability to function, a liver transplant is the last treatment option.
 
It is a procedure to replace a patient’s liver with a healthy liver from a deceased donor or with part of a liver from a living donor. Candidates for liver transplants undergo extensive testing to find whether they are healthy enough to have a good outcome following surgery.","Complications Of Fatty Liver Disease

Fatty liver disease can turn into a life-threatening condition if it progresses into inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver. And, if left untreated, it can eventually lead to the following:
1. Bleeding 
Inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis can affect the liver's ability to make enough clotting factors. Hence, the chance of severe bleeding increases.
2. Jaundice
Fatty liver diseases may affect the liver’s ability to eliminate high levels of bilirubin, a waste product, from the blood leading to jaundice.
3. Infections
Fatty liver disease also reduces the body’s immunity to fight infections. Fatty liver is associated with recurrent bacterial infections.
4. Chronic viral hepatitis
Progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis is more rapid when there is any form of concomitant liver infection with fatty liver disease. 

5. Osteoporosis

Some patients tend to lose their bone strength and are at a higher risk of bone fractures. Research shows that patients with NAFLD were 1.35 times more likely to develop osteoporosis when compared to individuals without NAFLD.

6. Diabetes 

Diabetes may worsen if someone already has it and develops cirrhosis and complete liver damage. 
 
7. Liver failure
Patients who are suffering from long-term fatty liver disease have the highest risk of liver failure.

8. Liver cancer 

Scarring and cirrhosis increase the chances of liver cancer, most commonly a type called hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 
9. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP)
It is a rare but serious complication that occurs during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Proper delivery and supportive care can help the patient with better recovery.
Note: Liver health will likely return to normal within a few weeks of giving birth.","Alternative Therapies For Fatty Liver Disease

Complementary therapies that can help on managing the symptoms of NAFLD include:
 
1. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
TCM has been widely used to treat NAFLD for centuries in Asia, and its holistic concept shows advantages in the treatment of this condition. This treatment is mainly focused on preventing damage to the liver, increasing insulin sensitivity, and improving the immune system. 

2. Acupuncture therapy
This is another traditional Chinese medicine-based approach, in which thin needles are inserted into the body that helps in healing. A study has demonstrated that acupuncture can effectively treat NAFLD by inhibiting inflammation and promoting fat metabolism in liver cells.

3. Yoga
Yoga positions can strengthen and stimulate the liver and aid in releasing stored fat in the form of energy. Certain yoga positions help improve liver functions and fatty liver diseases.

","Symptoms Of Female Infertility
 
The main symptom of infertility is not being able to get pregnant. Symptoms can also depend on many health conditions that can make it difficult to conceive a child. Some of the symptoms include:



Abnormal, irregular, or no periods


Bleeding during menstruation is heavier or lighter than usual


Painful periods with back pain, pelvic pain, and cramping


Pain during intercourse


Other symptoms indicating hormonal imbalance, such as:


Acne and skin problems


Changes in sex drive and desire


Dark hair growth on face 


Thinning or loss of hair


Weight gain

To understand the cause of infertility we should understand the steps in conception first and how any problem in each step can hamper your chances of getting pregnant. These include:
1. Sperm transport
The sperms need to travel through the female vagina and cervix to the site of fertilization for the pregnancy to occur. Any changes in the female environment due to hormonal imbalance can destroy the sperm, inhibiting fertilization.
2. Egg transport
This process starts during ovulation (release of an egg from one of the ovaries) where the egg is then picked up by the fallopian tubule where it travels to the uterus. Conditions such as pelvic infections and endometriosis can permanently impair the function of the fallopian tubes, leading to infertility.
3. Fertilization and embryo development
This is the most important step that consists of a union between the sperm and egg for the pregnancy to occur. Any impairments in the fallopian tubule can result in fertilization taking place in the tubules itself leading to ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus).
4. Implantation
It is a process in which the embryo attaches to the surface of the uterus and starts developing into a baby. Abnormalities in the uterus, hormonal or metabolic imbalances, infections, or immunological factors can lead to defective implantation, causing miscarriages.

The various factors that can cause infertility in females include:
1. Ovarian causes


Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): It is a hormonal disorder in which ovaries produce large amounts of male sex hormones or androgens which interfere with the development and release of eggs. Some of these eggs develop into cysts, which are little sacs filled with liquid, hence the name, polycystic ovary syndrome. PCOS has been linked to infertility in women.

Premature ovarian failure (POF): Refers to the loss of function of the ovaries before the age of 40. It is characterized by a decrease in the hormone estrogen, loss of female egg cells, and infertility.


Hyperprolactinemia: High levels of the hormone Prolactin, interferes with the normal production of other female hormones, like estrogen and progesterone. This can change or halt ovulation. It can also lead to irregular or missed periods. 


2. Tubal and peritoneal causes


Inflammatory diseases: Infection of one or more of the upper reproductive organs, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries can cause inflammation and predispose to infertility issues.


Endometriosis: It is a condition characterized by the growth of tissue resembling the lining of the uterus outside the uterus. This extra tissue and its surgical removal can cause scarring, blocking the fallopian tubes and making it difficult for the egg and sperm to meet.


3. Structural abnormalities


Uterine anomalies: The uterine malformations characterized by adhesions and/or fibrosis within the uterine cavity can lead to infertility.




Fallopian tube anomalies: Any obstruction in the tubules doesn’t let the ovum and the sperm converge, making fertilization unfeasible. 




Cervical anomalies: Cervical stenosis (narrowing or closing of the passageway through the cervix- the lower part of the uterus) might affect natural fertility by impeding the passage of semen into the uterus.

","Risk Factors For Female Infertility

1. Age
Fertility declines with advancing age. The 20s and early 30s are usually the best time to conceive. It becomes difficult to conceive after the age of 35.
2. Being underweight or overweight
BMI (body mass index) plays an important role in fertility. Being significantly overweight or underweight can cause hormonal changes that can affect fertility rates.

4. Genetic factors
Gene mutations can cause female infertility and pregnancy disorders.
5. Environmental factors
These include exposure to pesticides, radiation, air pollution, heavy metals, and other chemicals that can disrupt the hormones leading to infertility.
6. Hormonal disorders


Thyroid conditions: Thyroid diseases are associated with an increased risk of prematurity or stillbirth and can affect fertility.




Diabetes: Studies show that diabetic women are at increased risk of infertility, delayed puberty, absence of periods, menstrual irregularities and possibly earlier menopause.

Others: Excess growth hormone and testosterone also increase the risk of female infertility.


7. Lifestyle


Diet: Food items with a high glycemic index (shows how your blood sugar (glucose) level changes after eating a specific food item) can cause infertility among women. Moreover, packaged, processed, and fried foods predispose to obesity and diabetes, both known risk factors for female infertility.




Smoking: In women, smoking can increase the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy (when fertilized egg implants and grows outside the uterus.)

Continuous or sustained: A minor change (0.3°C or less) in the elevated temperature during 24 hours.


Relapsing fever: It is a variant of remittent fever in which fever spikes are separated by days or weeks. 

","Causes Of Fever
Fever is the body’s defense system that fights infection. However, a severe fever may indicate a critical condition requiring immediate medical intervention. 
Before understanding the exact cause of fever, it is essential to know about the pyrogens:
Pyrogen is a substance that provokes fever. There are two types of pyrogens:


Exogenous pyrogens: These substances originate from outside the body and can induce endogenous pyrogens. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, and drugs.  


Endogenous pyrogens: These are certain substances produced by the body that can induce fever. 


Fever occurs through the following steps:


Exogenous pyrogens trigger the release of endogenous pyrogens.


These endogenous pyrogens are transmitted to the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus (a part of the brain that controls many body functions).


It induces the synthesis of other chemicals, such as prostaglandins. 


These prostaglandins raise the body’s set-point temperature, leading to fever.


 
Did you know?
 


Hyperthermia or overheating can also cause a sudden and uncontrolled increase in body temperature (above 41°C). This is usually caused by excessive heat from the surroundings. 


However, it is different from fever. In a fever, the hypothalamus increases the body’s set-point temperature. Meanwhile, in hyperthermia, the body’s core temperature rises above the set point due to a thermoregulation failure.


Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are forms of hyperthermia.

","Diagnosis Of Fever
 
Diagnosis may involve detailed medical history and lab tests to identify the cause of fever. 
1. Medical history 
A thorough medical history helps identify the exact cause of the fever. The information regarding the following points is captured through patient interaction:


Onset and duration of fever


Degree of temperature


Mode of measuring temperature by the patient 


Medications


Mode of measuring temperature


Exposure to any toxins


Recent travel


Recent vaccination


2. Physical examination
It includes looking for signs such as shock, weak peripheral pulses, increased heart rate, respiratory distress, spots on the skin, discoloration of the skin, and decreased mental status.
 
3. Temperature measurement 


Oral temperature: It is used for cooperative patients older than 4-5 years of age. A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer of 100 °F (37.8 °C) or higher is considered a fever. 


Axillary temperature: It only determines the peripheral temperature, not the core body temperature. A temperature reading of >37.2°C (>99°F) is considered high.


Rectal temperature: It measures temperature in children 3 years or younger. A temperature of 38°C (100.4°F) or higher is considered a fever. A special rectal thermometer measures rectal temperature. 


Ear (tympanic temperature): In this, the temperature is measured using special tympanic thermometers, or digital ear thermometers. A temperature higher than 37.9°C (100.2°F) is considered fever. 


Forehead temperature: The temperature of the forehead is measured using electronic forehead thermometers. These thermometers read the heat waves from the temporal artery (blood vessels that run across the forehead just below the skin). Forehead temperature is usually 0.3 °C (0.5 °F) to 0.6 °C (1 °F) lower than an oral temperature.


 
The accuracy of all mode of temperature measurement is as follows: 
 
Rectal > Forehead > Oral and Ear > Armpit

4. Blood tests
Depending on the symptoms and medical history, certain blood tests can aid in identifying the cause of fever:
 


Complete blood count


Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)


C-reactive protein (CRP)


Procalcitonin


Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)


Rheumatoid factor (RF) test


Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test


Creatine phosphokinase test (CPK)


Serum protein electrophoresis


 
5. Urine routine and microscopy
Urine tests can help to rule out any urinary infections. 
 
6. Stool culture and sensitivity
A stool culture is indicated if there is a suspicion of bacterial enteritis. It is usually done in the presence of specific symptoms, such as blood in the stool or certain exposures.
 
7. Lumbar puncture
Lumbar puncture refers to inserting a hollow needle into the space surrounding the spinal column to collect Cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless, watery fluid that flows in and around the brain and spinal cord. 
A lumbar puncture is necessary when sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis is suspected.
8. Imaging tests
Based on the above results, various imaging tests are performed, including chest radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging.
Note: Individuals can be prescribed other specific tests according to their history and symptoms.

","Types Of Fistula
Fistulas can occur in different parts of the body, thereby can be defined and termed differently as well.  A fistula can form between: 


Artery and a vein


Cervix and the vagina


Neck and throat


Bile ducts and surface of the skin


Skull and nasal sinus


Bowel and vagina


Stomach and the surface of the skin


Navel and the gut


Artery and the vein in lungs


Uterus and peritoneal cavity (space between the abdomen and internal organs)


Colon and surface of the body, causing feces to exit through an opening other than the anus


Based on the nature
Based on the nature, the different types of fistula:Blind: As the name suggests, the fistula that opens in only one end and is closed at the other end is called the blind fistula. Complete: A complete fistula has openings both outside and inside the body. Horseshoe: A horseshoe fistula connects the anus to the surface of the skin after going around the rectum.Incomplete: An incomplete fistula is a tube from the skin that is closed on the inside and does not connect to any internal structure.

Based on anatomical location 

Based on the  location, the different types of fistulae are listed below:Anal fistulas: Anal fistulas are the most common type of fistulas. The anal fistula is developed between the anus and another organ system such as the rectum, vagina and colon. These three therefore can be defined as three subcategories of aval fistulas:

Anorectal fistula
Colovaginal fistula 
Anovaginal fistula 

Intestinal fistulas: Intestinal fistula is developed between the small intestine and the skin or colon and the skin. Bladder or urinary tract fistula: A bladder fistula is when an opening forms between the bladder and some other organ or the skin. Commonly the bladder opens to the bowel (enterovesical fistula) or the vagina (vesicovaginal fistula).Gastrointestinal fistula: It is an abnormal opening in the stomach of intestines that allows the leakage of contents. They can be classified as enteroenteric (where the leaks go through a part of the intestines) or enterocutaneous (where the leaks go through to the skin) fistula. Obstetric fistula: It is an abnormal opening formed between the birth canal (genital tract) and the urinary tract or rectum due to obstructed labor during childbirth. Vaginal fistulas: It is an abnormal opening that connects the vagina to another organ such as the bladder, colon or the rectum. The different types of vaginal fistulas include:Vesicovaginal fistula: Also called bladder fistula, it is a common type of vaginal fistula. The opening develops between the vagina and urinary bladder. Urethrovaginal fistula: It is also called urethral fistula. This type of fistula develops between the vagina and the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra). Ureterovaginal fistula: This type of fistula develops between the vagina and the ducts that carry urine from the kidneys to the ureters (bladder).  Rectovaginal fistula: This type of fistula develops between the vagina and the lower portion of the large intestine (rectum). Colovaginal fistula: This type of fistula develops between the vagina and the colon.Enterovaginal fistula: This type of fistula develops between the vagina and the small intestine.","Symptoms Of Fistula 
Symptoms vary depending upon where the fistula is located. They range from mild to serious ones. Most commonly, there will be no specific symptom until the condition becomes more advanced. However, some individuals experience one or two symptoms only. But others might develop multiple symptoms simultaneously. Some of the commonly observed symptoms of fistula are:


Body pain 


Pain around the anus


Vague feeling of being unwell or uncomfortable 


Constant urine leakage from the vagina 


Irritation in the external female genital organs 


Nausea


Abdominal pain


Vomiting


Fever


Weight loss


Diarrhea


Constipation


Frequent urinary tract infection

","Causes of Fistula 
Depending on the type and location of the fistula, there could be different reasons for occurrence. In some cases, they could be formed naturally and in others could be an after-effect of an injury or surgery. Gastrointestinal diseases: People suffering from gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn’s disease, colitis and irritable bowel diseases are at a higher risk of developing fistulas near the anus. Around 1 in 3 people with Crohn’s will likely develop a fistula at some time.Diverticular diseases: Diverticular disease is a digestive disease. Diverticulosis is a condition that occurs when small sacs form and push outward through weak spots in the wall of the colon. Radiation therapy: Patients undergoing radiation therapy as a cancer treatment or otherwise, are at a high risk of developing fistulas.Certain infections: Some infections and diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis can also cause fistulas. Women’s health and childbirth: Prolonged or obstructed childbirth, injury during pelvic surgery, radiation treatment in the pelvic or genital area are common causes for vaginal fistulas. Surgical and medical treatment: Certain surgical treatments can lead to fistulas.eg. Complications from gallbladder surgery can lead to biliary fistulas. Radiation therapy to the pelvis can lead to vesicovaginal fistulas. Therapeutic use: In people with kidney failure, requiring dialysis, a cimino fistula is often deliberately created in the arm in order to permit easier withdrawal of blood for hemodialysis. During treatment of portal hypertension, surgical creation of a portacaval fistula produces an anastomosis between the hepatic portal vein and the inferior vena cava. This spares the portal venous system from high pressure which can cause many complications.The cause for developing different types of fistulas vary according to the type and are discussed separately below:Anal fistula: Anal fistula are more common in men aged between 30-50 years of age. Anal fistulas can be caused by damaged tissues and is often linked to cysts or an infection of the anal glands.

Clogged anal glands
Anal abscesses
Crohn’s disease
Tuberculosis
Diverticulosis 
Cancer
Radiation therapy 
Trauma 
Sexually transmitted diseases 

Vaginal fistula: In women, fistulas involve the genitals and urinary tracts. Common causes of these fistulas are:

Prolonged or obstructed childbirth
Injury during pelvic surgery
Radiation treatment in the pelvic or genital area
Infection and inflammation
","Risk Factors For Fistula

Though the exact cause of fistula is still unknown. However, there are conditions that put some individuals at a higher risk of developing fistulas. Some of these risk factors include:
Previous history of anal abscess or fistula
Anal fistulas can be caused by damaged tissues and is often linked to cysts or an infection of the anal glands. 

Crohn’s disease 

As per studies, 70% of Crohn’s disease patients suffer from fistula and resulting intestinal obstruction during their disease course. 
Certain infections 
Some infections and diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis can also cause fistulas. 
Previous surgery or radiation therapy
Patients who have had surgeries in the past or are undergoing radiation therapy as a cancer treatment or otherwise, are at a high risk of developing fistulas.Can aging cause constipation? This & 5 more myths about constipation!Know More!",,"Specialist To Visit

If proper medical care is provided to the patient, fistulas can be treated and prevented. Different treatment options for fistula includes:

Surgical treatment 

If the fistula fails to respond to the medications and antibiotics, surgical treatment might be needed to remove the fistula.
Fistulotomy 
It is the most effective and common type of surgery that involves cutting along the whole length of the fistula to open it up so it heals as a flat scar. It is a surgical treatment for many fistulas (such as anal fistula) that do not pass through much of the sphincter muscles, as it may cause a risk of incontinence. 
Transabdominal surgery
It is the simple procedure wherein the rectovaginal septum is dissected, the fistula is divided and the rectum and vagina are closed primarily without bowel resection. 

Laparoscopic surgery
It is a minimally invasive surgery that involves a tiny incision and the use of cameras and small tools to repair the fistula. 

Endorectal flap procedure 
It is a procedure where healthy tissue is pulled over the internal side of the fistula to keep feces or other material from reinfecting the channel.

Medications
Depending on the condition and severity of the disease, the doctor prescribes medications that include:


Antibiotics will help fight against bacterial infection that if left untreated could worsen the patient’s condition. Commonly prescribed drugs include metronidazole and ciprofloxacin that may help reduce the discharge and promote comfort.




Anti-inflammatory medicines are usually recommended for people with Crohn’s diseases or diverticular disease. It helps control the existing fistula from worsening and prevents new ones from developing.




Immunomodulatory drugs have shown to help close the fistula in some. Commonly prescribed drugs include azathioprine, it acts slowly therefore may take up to 3 months to show results. 


Pain relief medications help  to reduce the pain and discomfort caused due to the fistula.


Non-invasive treatment 
For small and relatively simple fistulas, doctors often use a minimally invasive technique to manage it. Commonly used non-invasive treatment options include:


Fibrin glue is a specialized, simple and painless therapeutic for fistulas that are small and do not require an invasive treatment. It is a medicinal adhesive that activates thrombin to form a fibrin clot that forms a clot and seals the fistula tract. 




Collagen plugs are another method to seal the fistulas. Fistula is plugged up using collagen and is seen as a first line treatment for patients with simple fistulas. 




Seton technique is performed by inserting surgical thread inside the fistula tract that allows it to drain and heal completely. 


Follow-up treatment for fistulas 
Most people respond well to surgeries, however it is recommended to follow up with your doctor to avoid any complications. Book follow up appointments with your specialist or doctor in order to make sure the body is effectively responding to the medication and surgery and you are recovering well.  ","Home-care For Fistula

Your doctor may recommend or prescribe a barrier cream to protect ypur skin surrounding the wound/ fistula from any infection.




If you notice swelling, try lying on your stomach with a pillow under your hips. 




When you sit on the toilet seat, support your feet with a small step stool. This helps flex your hips and places your pelvis in a squatting position. This can make bowel movements easier after surgery.


Wear loose fitting clothing and cotton undergarments.


Apply ice several times a day for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. Put a thin cloth between your skin and the ice.


Try a sitz bath. Sit in 8 to 10 centimeters of warm water for 15 to 20 minutes. Then pat the area dry. Try it as long as you have pain in your anal area.


Wear a pad over your anal area until healing is complete.

 ","Complications Of Fistula

Fistulas can be difficult to deal with as they cause a lot of discomfort and pain. If the fistula is left untreated, it can cause serious complications. 
Bacterial infection or sepsis
As is with any surgery, one of the common complications is infection. It can have severe consequences and affect different body parts. If you notice an abscess, there is a chance for you to develop sepsis which can be threatening. Make sure to contact your doctor immediately if you notice any pus formation or infection.

Bowel incontinence

Damage to the anal sphincter muscles causes bowel incontinence. It can cause fecal leakage from the rectum. 

Fistula recurrence
Even after surgery, there are chances of recurrence of anal fistula. However, this recurrence primarily depends on the complexity and type of surgery performed.
Bowel obstruction
Damage to the anal sphincter muscles can cause bowel blockage or obstruction.","Living With Fistula

","Symptoms Of Gallbladder Stones
Gallbladder stones symptoms differ from person to person, depending on the size and location of gallstones. The most prominent and visible gallbladder stones symptoms are sudden intensifying abdominal pain and other related digestive problems. For most people, the gall stones may remain silent and do not show any signs and symptoms. These types of silent gallstones usually do not pose any major risks of health concerns. However, if the gallstones block or get into the bile duct, they may cause other health complications. So it is always advised to consult a physician immediately for an early diagnosis and treatment.Some of the common signs and symptoms of gallbladder stones include:1. Sudden intensifying pain in the stomach


Sudden pain in the stomach is the most common symptom of gallbladder stone. The pain usually occurs at the upper right portion of the abdomen and may radiate to other regions. 


Increased pressure within the gallbladder or a block in the bile duct due to gallstones may cause pain in the abdomen.


This pain can last for around 20 minutes to several hours.


2. Flatulence


Some people with gallstones may develop flatulence. 


An increased amount of gas secretion or gas buildup in the digestive system due to underlying health conditions such as gallbladder stones can also trigger flatulence.


3. Nausea and vomiting


Another common symptom of gallbladder stones is nausea and vomiting. Increased pressure in the gallbladder caused by gallstones may increase the fluid imbalance in the stomach, which in turn may cause nausea and vomiting. 


Other gallbladder symptoms include:


Pale or yellowish skin


Loss of appetite


Abdominal bloating


Chest pain


Radiating pain in the right shoulder


Fever


Clay-colour stools


The warning symptoms that require urgent medical care include:


Severe or radiating abdominal pain


Yellowing of skin or whites of the eye


Stomach bloating


Most of the above-mentioned symptoms of gallbladder stones may resemble other gastrointestinal problems, such as ulcer, appendicitis, or pancreatitis. So early recognition and treatment of gall bladder stones are crucial to reducing the risks associated with it.Kidney stones are not the same as gallstones. Here’s everything you need to know about kidney stones.Click To Know!","Causes Of Gallbladder Stones
The exact causes of gallbladder stones are not clearly understood. However, several factors are believed to contribute to the development of gallstones. Some possible causes of gallbladder stones include,

1. Imbalance of bilirubin in the bile

Elevated levels of bilirubin, a pigment secreted by the liver, may cause the accumulation of excess bilirubin in the body tissue. This, in turn, may contribute to the formation of gallstones.

2. Excessive secretion of cholesterol
Gallbladder stones develop when the liver secretes excessive cholesterol and results in the formation of cholesterol crystals, which develop into gallstones.

3. Improper emptying of the gallbladder

Improper emptying of the gallbladder, overtime may lead to the formation of mucus-like gallbladder sludge. This, in turn, may eventually develop into gallstones.

4. Insufficient bile salt concentration

Insufficient or imbalance in bile salt concentration correlates with an increased risk of developing gallbladder stones.

5. Diet and lifestyle

Certain lifestyle factors and improper dietary practices may also lead to the formation of stones in the gallbladder. These include:


Regular eating of highly processed and fried food items


Alcohol consumption


Stress


Obesity


Inactive or sedentary lifestyle

",,"Types Of Gallstones

The composition of gallstones is affected by age, diet and ethnicity. On the basis of their composition, gallstones can be divided into the following types: cholesterol stones, pigment stones, and mixed stones. An ideal classification system is yet to be defined.
Cholesterol stones
Cholesterol stones vary from light yellow to dark green or brown or chalk white and are oval, usually solitary, between 2 and 3 cm long, each often having a tiny, dark, central spot. To be classified as such, they must be at least 80% cholesterol by weight (or 70%, according to the Japanese–classification system). Between 35% and 90% of stones are cholesterol stones.

Pigment stones
Bilirubin (""pigment"", ""black pigment"") stones are small, dark (often appearing black), and usually numerous. They are composed primarily of bilirubin (insoluble bilirubin pigment polymer) and calcium (calcium phosphate) salts that are found in bile. They contain less than 20% of cholesterol (or 30%, according to the Japanese-classification system). Between 2% and 30% of stones are bilirubin stones.

Mixed stones
Mixed (brown pigment stones) typically contain 20–80% cholesterol (or 30–70%, according to the Japanese- classification system). Other common constituents are calcium carbonate, palmitate phosphate, bilirubin and other bile pigments (calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate and calcium stearate). Because of their calcium content, they are often radiographically visible. They typically arise secondary to infection of the biliary tract which results in the release of β-glucuronidase (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) which hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile. Between 4% and 20% of stones are mixed.Gallstones can vary in size and shape from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. The gallbladder may contain a single large stone or many smaller ones. Pseudoliths, sometimes referred to as sludge, are thick secretions that may be present within the gallbladder, either alone or in conjunction with fully formed gallstones.
Practicing  Dhanurasana Yoga Asana may help manage gallbladder stones better.Have you ever thought that practicing a specific type of yoga may help you manage gallstones? According to a study, ayurvedic integrated yoga may help improve gastrointestinal mobility, reduce pain, abdomen bloating and provide relief from the signs and symptoms of gallbladder stones. Regular practicing of dhanurasana yoga or bow pose may also improve the normal functioning of the digestive system as it involves stretching of the spine. However, this pose is not usually recommended for severe gall bladder stone cases.  ",,"Specialist To Visit

People who have silent gall bladder stones (asymptomatic gallstones) show mild symptoms and may not require any treatment. However, for people with gallstone complications and having intense pain in the abdomen, the following treatments may be required:

Nonsurgical treatments

MedicationsThe medications used to treat the gallbladder either work by breaking the cholesterol accumulation in the stomach acids or decreasing the cholesterol secretion in the bile. The most commonly used medicines for gallbladder stones include:Ursodeoxycholic acid: Ursodeoxycholic acid or ursodiol is a naturally-occurring bile acid effective in the prevention of gallstones. It works by dissolving the excess cholesterol or gall stone crystals in the gut. This class of medications is approved by the FDA for the treatment of gallstones. However, it may require a longer time to work. So the use of these medications is only considered for mild and less serious cases.Chenodiol: Chenodiol or Chenodeoxycholic acid is also a naturally occurring bile acid used to treat gallstones. It works by preventing the secretion of excess cholesterol in the liver that develops into gallstones.However, the use of this medication does not guarantee immediate recovery or results. It is commonly used by people who cannot undergo gallbladder surgery.Other non-FDA approved medications to treat small gallbladder stones include::


Actigall


Reltone


Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy is a non-invasive procedure that uses pressured waves to break gallstones externally. However, this technique involves the use of high-tech equipment and is rarely used along with other treatment methods.

Surgical treatments

Open cholecystectomy: One of the effective methods to cure gallstones is surgery. Surgical treatment usually involves removal of the gallbladder to avoid recurrence of gallstones.However, like other surgery, gallbladder surgery also comes with its own risk of complications.The most common complication is an internal bleeding injury to the bile ducts, infection. For which you may need one or more additional operations to repair the bile ducts.Laparoscopic surgery (cholecystectomy): Laparoscopic surgery, often known as keyhole surgery, is a highly effective technique widely used to treat gallbladder stones. It involves the use of a special probe to access the internal organs.The main advantage of laparoscopic surgery over traditional open surgery is that it requires minimal opening and a small incision to perform surgery. This, in turn, eliminates the major risks of open surgery such as infection, internal bleeding, or delayed recovery.Endoscopic gallbladder stenting: Endoscopic gallbladder stenting is effective for elderly patients with gallbladder diseases who are poor surgical candidates. This procedure uses stents (metal or plastic tube inserts) to keep the bile duct narrowed by gallstones open.Gallbladder stenting may also help resolve the symptoms caused by gallstones.",,"Home-care For Gallbladder Stones
Diet plays a crucial role in the management and treatment of gallbladder stones. Here are some dos and don'ts you need to follow to help your body manage gallstones symptoms:
Dos


Consume food rich in fiber, such as vegetables and fruits.


Don’t miss out on micronutrients, consume a well-rounded diet such as legumes and whole grains.


Keep your blood pressure under control.


Make sure to break your large meal into small meals—for example, instead of eating one large meal, break it into 3 small meals.


Practice low intense stretch exercises to help proper digestion.


Make sure to chew your food slowly and properly.


Stay hydrated, drink lots of water.


Herbs such as Saindhava lavanam and peppermint may help you manage the signs of gallstones.


Don'ts


Eat too many fried, spicy, or ready-made packed food items like pasta, noodles, polished rice, and sugar.


Drink aerated cool drinks such as soda and ice beverages, excessively


Smoke or consume alcohol


Perform high intense physical activities like weight lifting, sprinting, or boxing


Eat high fat or calcium-rich food


Self-medicate

","Complications Of Gallbladder Stones
Usually, asymptomatic gallstones do not cause any complications. However, if the symptoms are left untreated, it can lead to severe complications. According to the Nigerian Journal of Surgery, the medical complications associated with gallbladder stones are as follows:


Inflammation of the gallbladder can lead to a more serious medical condition called cholecystitis


Blockage of bile duct resulting in bile infection or jaundice


Gallbladder cancer


Blockage in the pancreatic duct leading to pancreatitis, a serious medical condition where the pancreas get inflamed due to the presence of blockage


Small bowel obstruction or gallstone ileus, a rare but serious complication where the intestine losses its ability to contraction 


Mirizzi's syndrome, a condition where the bile stone becomes impacted with the neck of the gallbladder


Internal bleeding or gastrointestinal distress

","Symptoms Of Gastritis 
 
Gastritis refers to the inflammation of the lining of the stomach. This inflammation can disrupt the normal production of stomach acid and digestive enzymes, which are important for the breakdown and digestion of food. As a result, individuals with gastritis may experience the following symptoms:

Piercing, gripping pain in the stomach
Feeling of fullness
Burning feeling in the stomach between meals or at night
Burning feeling in the chest due to acid reflux
Belching or burping
Lack of appetite
Stomach bloating
Hiccups
Nausea and vomiting
Diarrhea


Symptoms of severe gastritis may include:

Blood in vomit
Black, tarry stools
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Weakness
High fever
Inability to take any foods or liquids by the mouth.
",,"Types of Gastritis
 
There are broadly two types of gastritis, acute and chronic.

1. Acute gastritis


It is characterized by a sudden inflammation of the stomach lining, commonly caused by irritants or infections. 


It leads to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, bloating, gas, weight loss, and loss of appetite. 


Simple treatments and removal of the underlying cause usually result in a quick resolution of symptoms.



2. Chronic gastritis


It refers to persistent, low-grade inflammation and damage to the stomach lining, often associated with H. pylori infection.


People with chronic gastritis often have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. Symptoms might include tiredness and anemia.



Note: Gastritis refers to inflammation of the stomach lining, while antral gastritis specifically involves inflammation of the antrum, which is the lower part of the stomach near the entrance to the small intestine.
","Causes Of Gastritis
I. Major Causes and Risk factors
Infectious agents especially Helicobacter pylori, and NSAIDs are responsible for the majority of people with gastritis:
1. H.Pylori-associated gastritis
H.pylori gastritis is one of the most common causes of gastritis. It occurs due to the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria in the stomach that infect the stomach lining and cause inflammation. It is often contracted through contaminated food or water.
 
2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Frequent or long-term use of NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen can irritate the stomach lining, causing erosive gastritis. These medications can disrupt the protective mechanisms of the stomach, leading to inflammation.
 
Prolonged use of painkillers can affect the regulation of prostaglandin hormones. Prostaglandins help regulate stomach mucus and substances that neutralize the gastric acid. Without enough prostaglandin, the stomach wall loses protection from acid.
 
Note: Combined use of painkillers with steroids can worsen the damaging effects on the gastric lining.
 
II. Other Causes and Risk factors
The following factors can also contribute to the development of gastritis. Chronic gastritis is a condition that may develop due to repeated or persistent exposure to many of these factors.
 


Virus: Viruses such as enterovirus, epstein-Barr virus, can cause viral gastritis. 




Parasitic infections: Parasites such as cryptosporidium are also known to cause gastritis.




Fungal infections: Fungal infections such as candidiasis can also cause gastritis. Fungal infections typically occur in individuals with weakened immune systems.


Alcohol: Heavy or prolonged alcohol consumption can irritate and damage the stomach lining, making individuals more susceptible to alcohol gastritis.




Smoking: Smoking has been identified as a risk factor for gastritis. It can weaken the protective lining of the stomach and impair the healing process, increasing the risk of inflammation.

Age: Gastritis can affect individuals of any age, but the risk tends to increase with age. Older adults may have a higher risk due to factors such as a weakened immune system, prolonged use of medications, and a higher likelihood of H. pylori infection.


 


Stress: While stress itself may not directly cause gastritis, it can worsen symptoms and increase the risk of developing the condition. Chronic stress may influence the production of stomach acid and disrupt the normal functioning of the digestive system.


 


Autoimmune disorders: In some cases, the immune system may mistakenly attack the cells of the stomach lining, leading to autoimmune gastritis. This type of gastritis is less common but can be chronic and severe.


Systemic conditions: Certain systemic diseases can also contribute to the development of gastritis. Some of them are discussed below:




Crohn's disease (a type of inflammatory bowel disease)


Vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels)


Sarcoidosis (growth of inflammatory cells)


Ischemia (reduced blood flow)


 


Bile reflux: When bile from the small intestine flows back into the stomach, it can irritate and inflame the stomach lining, causing gastritis. 


 


Radiation Therapy: Exposure to high doses of radiation, such as during radiation therapy for cancer treatment, can cause gastritis. The radiation damages the cells of the stomach lining, leading to inflammation and discomfort.


 


Obesity: While obesity itself is not considered a direct risk factor for gastritis, it can still play an indirect role in its development. Obesity-related factors such as acid reflux, increased stomach pressure, and unhealthy dietary choices have the potential to irritate the stomach lining and exacerbate symptoms of gastritis. 

","Diagnosis Of Gastritis
 
Your doctor will take a thorough medical history, including any medications you are taking and your family history. This will be followed by a physical examination.

To diagnose gastritis, doctors typically use a combination of the following tests:

1. Esophageal pH testThis test helps measure stomach acid by checking how much stomach acid enters through the food pipe and how long it stays in the stomach. 

2. Lab tests


CBC - This test checks for high levels of white blood cells indicative of inflammation or infection. The test also looks for anemia, or a low red blood cell count, an indicator of blood loss, which can be linked to gastritis.




Stool test- It checks for H. Pylori or other infections. It is also useful in ruling out other infections that cause chronic diarrhea.


H. Pylori Breath test- In this test, you are given a special solution to swallow. If the H. pylori bacteria are present in the gut, gas by-products are released and detected in your breath.


Helicobacter Pylori Antibodies Panel (IgA, IgG & IgM) test - This test is used to detect the presence of IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies against H. pylori infection.



3. Imaging tests


Upper Endoscopy- During this procedure, a small flexible tube (known as an endoscope) is inserted down the throat to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine.




Barium swallow test (esophagram): In this procedure, you need to drink a liquid barium mixture. An X-ray of the chest and upper abdomen is then done to help identify any physical excessive alcohol consumption or any other abnormalities in the stomach or esophagus.



4. Biopsy: A small piece of tissue is removed from the inside of the stomach for further testing and analysis. ","Prevention Of Gastritis
While it is not possible to completely eliminate the risk of gastritis, there are measures you can take to reduce it. Here are some tips that may help prevent gastritis:
 
1. Make dietary changes
A clean, well-balanced wholesome diet is the cornerstone of overall health and immunity and can help evade gastritis. At the same time, it is important to identify and avoid any specific foods or beverages that seem to worsen your symptoms. 
 
Consume


Fiber-rich foods 


Flavonoid and antioxidant-rich fruits, vegetables, and beverages 


Foods high in B vitamins, calcium, and protein like almonds, whole grains, leafy greens, and lean meats.


Healthier cooking oils like olive oil, ghee


6 to 8 glasses of filtered water daily


 
Avoid or limit


Refined foods such as white breads, pastas, sugar etc.


Excessive intake of oily and spicy foods.


Refined white sugar and sugar-containing items like cakes, muffins, cookies etc.


Stomach irritants like coffee, alcohol, and carbonated drinks.


Overeating to prevent excessive acid production and strain on digestion.


 
2. Avoid excessive use of NSAIDs 


Excessive and prolonged use of NSAIDs, commonly used for pain relief, are a main culprit when it comes to gastritis. 




It is crucial to adhere to healthcare professional’s instructions when using NSAIDs, avoid long-term usage without medical supervision, and consider alternative pain management methods whenever available.


 
3. Reduce the risk of H. pylori infection from contaminated food and water


Practice good hand hygiene, wash hands before handling food, after using the bathroom, and after contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. 


Cook meat thoroughly, avoid cross-contamination, and promptly refrigerate perishable foods.


Drink safe, clean water and avoid consuming raw or undercooked foods.


 
4. Quit smoking


Smoking weakens the stomach lining and impairs healing.


Seek supportive measures like counselling, nicotine replacement therapy, and behavioral therapies for quitting.

5. Limit or abstain from alcohol


Excessive intake of alcohol can cause irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining. It is important to avoid engaging in binge drinking. Consumption of alcohol should always be practiced in moderation. 


Men should limit their alcohol intake to a maximum of two drinks per day, while women and the elderly should not exceed one drink per day.


However, it is advisable to consider complete abstinence from alcohol, particularly if one has liver disease.


 
6. Manage stress effectively


Long term stress can worsen gastritis symptoms and delay healing. 


Techniques like deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, and mindfulness-based stress reduction can help manage stress levels and promote relaxation. 


Engaging in activities that bring joy and practicing good self-care habits can also be beneficial.

The treatment of gastritis depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. The treatment starts with identifying the possible causes of acute gastritis, such as long-term use of NSAIDs, excessive alcohol consumption, or H. pylori infection. The following medications and supplements are usually prescribed for the management of gastritis:
 
I. Medications
1. Antibiotics: If an infection causes gastritis, such as H. pylori, the following antibiotics may be prescribed to eliminate the bacteria


Clarithromycin


Amoxicillin


Metronidazole 


 
2. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI): Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) aid in relieving the symptoms of gastritis by decreasing gastric acid production. Examples include:


Esomeprazole


Lansoprazole


Omeprazole 


Pantoprazole


Rabeprazole


 
Note: Doctors commonly use ""triple therapy"" to treat H. pylori-related gastritis and ulcers. This therapy includes a combination of a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics. In most cases, triple therapy will successfully eliminate the infection. If additional treatment is required, doctors usually recommend quad therapy. This involves one PPI and three different antibiotics.
 
4. Antacids: Antacids neutralize the acid already in your stomach. It may relieve heartburn or indigestion but will not treat an ulcer. A few antacids include:


Aluminum hydroxide 


Magnesium hydroxide 


Calcium carbonate 


Sodium bicarbonate


 
3. Histamine-2 (H2) blockers: H2 blockers reduce acid production. These are usually more effective than antacids in relieving symptoms, and many people find them far more convenient. 
H2 blockers include:


Cimetidine 


Ranitidine


Nizatidine 


Famotidine 


 
Note: Doctors may also prescribe sucralfate, which helps to coat the stomach lining and treat stomach ulcers.

1. Infectious gastroenteritis

Infections causing gastroenteritis can be viral, bacterial, or parasitic in origin. Viruses: The most common viruses responsible for gastroenteritis are: 


Norovirus: It is the most common cause and is responsible for most cases of viral gastroenteritis. The virus is mostly responsible for outbreaks within closed communities such as nursing homes, schools, military populations, athletic teams, and cruise ships.




Rotavirus: The virus is mostly responsible for severe vomiting in young children and infants. The infection of rotavirus in children and infants may require hospitalization. 


Less common viruses that can cause gastroenteritis include astrovirus and adenovirus. How does viral gastroenteritis spread? 
Viral gastroenteritis is highly infectious. Viruses are present in the vomit and stool of the infected person and can live outside the human body for a long time. It can spread through: 


Direct contact with vomit or stool of infected person


Shaking hands with infected person


Touching contaminated surfaces and objects such as handrails, elevator buttons, utensils, doors etc. 


Sharing food and beverages with the infected person


Bacteria: Although not common, several species of bacteria can also cause gastroenteritis. They include:


Campylobacter: This bacteria spreads through contaminated milk and poultry products. 


Staphylococcus: It is most commonly found in undercooked meats, eggs, and dairy products. 


E. coli: This bacteria is mostly present in undercooked beef, and unwashed fruits and vegetables. 


Shigella: This bacteria usually grows in raw food and contaminated water such as swimming pools. 


How does bacterial gastroenteritis spread?
Improper storage and unhygienic handling of food can allow the bacteria to grow. Bacterial gastroenteritis spreads very quickly by: 


Eating contaminated food and beverages


Handling stool of infected person


Parasite: Parasites refer to the organism that requires a host to grow and multiply. These organisms usually live in the intestine of the patient. The parasites that can cause gastroenteritis include:  


Entamoeba histolytica


Giardia lamblia


Cryptosporidium


How does parasitic gastroenteritis spread?
The parasites are usually present in the bowel of infected humans and animals and can spread through: 


Swimming in a contaminated pool and accidentally swallowing water, or through contact with infected animals


Handling infected animals 


Changing the nappy of an infected baby and not washing your hands afterwards


2. Chemicals
Gastroenteritis can also be caused by foods contaminated with chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic or by directly consuming a heavy metal or chemical. 
3. Medications
Gastroenteritis can be a side effect of some medications such as :


Antacids containing magnesium as a major ingredient


Antibiotics


Chemotherapy drugs


Colchicine


Digoxin 


Laxatives


Confirming the drug as a cause of gastroenteritis is difficult. To recognize this, doctors are usually asked to discontinue the therapy and observe the clinical changes.",,"Risk Factors For Gastroenteritis

The treatment of gastroenteritis is based upon the cause and symptoms. The most important goal of the therapy is to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance that is disturbed due to vomiting and persistent diarrhea.In some cases such as severe dehydration, uncontrolled vomiting, severe electrolyte disturbances, significant renal failure, continuous abdominal pain, and pregnancy, hospital admission is required. The treatment protocols may include: 
Fluid therapy
Most cases of mild dehydration can easily be managed at home through fluid therapy.


It is advised to drink plenty of fluids to compensate for water loss and prevent dehydration.  


Oral rehydration solutions are preferred over other clear fluids for managing  diarrhea.




Fluids high in sugar (such as cola, apple juice, and sports drink) should be avoided as they may aggravate dehydration and diarrhea.




Patients having severe dehydration and persistent vomiting may require hospital admission for continuous monitoring of electrolyte level. 


Enteral (oral or nasogastric) and intravenous fluids (Saline solution and lactate Ringer’s solutions) are given to patients facing difficulty in taking fluids due to nausea, vomiting, and to correct electrolyte levels. 


Zinc supplementation
Zinc is a metal that is found in a variety of foods such as meat, fish, almonds, and cereals. Diarrhea, the most common symptom of gastroenteritis, is associated with severe zinc deficiency. Zinc supplementation is a very safe and effective way for reducing complications due to gastroenteritis in children. WHO recommends the intake of 10 to 20 mg of zinc for 10 to 14 days for the management of diarrhea in children. It is given in the form of zinc sulfate, zinc acetate, or zinc gluconate.
Probiotics
Probiotics are effective in the treatment of diarrhea, especially for diseases with an infectious origin. The use of probiotics is associated with the reduction in the duration of the diarrhea, if started immediately after the onset of symptoms. 
Antibiotics
They are mostly used to treat gastroenteritis caused by bacteria. Some of the commonly used antibiotics in gastroenteritis include metronidazole, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. 
Antiemetics 
Antiemetic medications are the drugs that are used to control nausea and vomiting. The commonly used antiemetic medications are ondansetron and metoclopramide. 
Antidiarrheal medications
Antidiarrheal medications are used only in those patients who are not able to maintain a well-hydrated status. Medications such as diphenoxylate, atropine are used.","Home-care For Gastroenteritis

Keep a watch on fluid intake

It is advised to have plenty of fluids like fresh fruit juices, coconut water, clear soups etc. In case of severe vomiting, take small sips of fluids at regular intervals. The mothers of the infected infants should make sure that their babies are getting enough breast milk. 
Have ice chips
If you are facing difficulty in digesting fluids, try to suck ice chips. This also helps in rehydration. The ice chips should not be given to small children. 
Add these foods to your diet


B.R.A.T stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These food items should be included in the diet as it helps in making the stool smooth and helps in compensating the nutrient loss from vomiting and diarrhea.


Foods like chicken or other lean meats, whole grains and potatoes help in reducing the symptoms of gastroenteritis


It is also advised to consume smaller easy to digest meals at regular intervals.
Avoid certain foods
Certain food items should be avoided as they can make the stomach upset and can cause indigestion. The impaired digestion can aggravate diarrhea and vomiting. These include:


Greasy and spicy food containing chilly, black pepper, and garlic 


Drinks with caffeine, such as coffee and tea, and some soft drinks.


Fatty junk foods such as fried foods, pizza, and fast foods.


Foods and drinks containing large amounts of simple sugars, such as sweetened beverages and packaged fruit juices.


Milk and milk products, containing the sugar lactose which can cause some people to develop lactose intolerance 


Take proper rest
People with gastroenteritis should take proper rest even after the completion of therapy. This will lead to complete recovery and healing of the digestive system. 
Try heating pad 
Some patients of gastroenteritis suffer from severe abdominal pain. Such patients can use a heating pad to relieve cramps.  
Say no to alcohol
Alcohol can cause inflammation in the stomach. This can increase the secretion of gastric acid. So, alcohol should be avoided as it can increase the feeling of vomiting (nausea). ",,"Complications Of Gastroenteritis
In most of the cases, gastroenteritis is resolved through fluid therapy and medications. However, persistent diarrhea and vomiting can lead to: 1. Dehydration2. Metabolic acidosis3. Electrolyte imbalance 


Hypernatraemia (high levels of sodium)


Hyponatraemia (low levels of sodium)


Hypokalaemia (high levels of potassium)


Development of intolerance to food such as lactose, glucose, cow’s milk, and soy protein4. Increase susceptibility to infection5. Dehydration can lead to more serious problems, such as:


Heat stroke: Lack of fluids could lead to heatstroke. This is more common in physically active patients. 


Kidney disorders: The long episode of dehydration can develop or trigger kidney stones, urinary tract infections (UTIs), or even kidney failure. 


Seizures: The electrolyte imbalance can also develop seizures in the long run.


Hypovolemic shock: This can develop due to low blood volume and a drop in blood pressure.

","Causes Of GERD
The stomach is connected to the mouth through a tube known as the esophagus. A muscle-like flap is present at the bottom of the esophagus known as the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The muscles of the LES relax and open when the food is eaten. This allows the food to go downwards.
There are several mechanisms involved in GERD which may include:1. Impaired LES function: In normal conditions, LES opens in response to a meal that facilitates the movement of food.  LES prevents the migration of gastric contents back into the esophagus. Individuals with GERD have more LES relaxations that are generally not triggered by food. This keeps the LES open even when it is not needed. It permits the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. 2. Impaired mucosal defense: The stomach has a protective layer known as mucosa which acts as a barrier against acidic contents. It is seen that prolonged stay of food in the stomach may alter the mucosal layer and may cause GERD. 3. Defective peristalsis: Peristalsis is a series of wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract. The impaired peristalsis can cause reflux of gastric contents back into the esophagus.
Here are 10 tips to nurture your digestive health.Click to know","Symptoms Of GERD
 
The major characteristic symptom of GERD is heartburn, experienced as a burning sensation or discomfort in the middle of the chest. This painful burning feeling is felt behind the breastbone, rising from the lower tip of your breastbone toward your throat.
The discomfort may radiate to the neck and typically occurs after taking food. Lying down also increases its occurrence.The other signs and symptoms include:


Regurgitation (backward flow of swallowed food from stomach to food pipe)


Acidic taste in the mouth


Choking while eating 


Aspiration (inhalation of stomach contents into the respiratory system)


Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing)


Odynophagia (pain while swallowing)


Belching (expelling excess air from your upper digestive tract)


Epigastric pain (upper abdominal pain)


Hypersalivation


Nausea


Persistent vomiting


Frequent burping


Extraesophageal symptoms


Chest pain


Chronic cough 


Persistent sore throat


Asthma


Laryngitis


Dysphonia (having abnormal voice)


Hoarseness of voice


Painless sensation of a lump in the throat


Loss of appetite


Unexplained weight loss


Dental erosions


Inflammation of the gums


Bad breath


Otitis media (infection of the middle ear)


In severe cases, GERD can cause bleeding in the digestive system which can be tracked by the following symptoms:


Vomiting having blood or coffee grounds


Dark coloured stool 

",,"Risk Factors For GERD

1. Old age
Aging increases the risk of GERD to several folds. This is due to the disruption of the tonicity of LES in old age. 
2. Eating habits
There are several eating habits that may increase the risk of GERD. These include:


Having fried, spicy, and sour food, especially at bedtime. These include orange and grapefruit juice, tomatoes and tomato preserves, chocolate, coffee/tea, and carbonated beverages.


Irregular meal timings.


Eating large portions at a time.


Having dinner just before bedtime. 


3. Consumption of excessive alcohol
Heavy drinking increases the risk of GERD by damaging the protective lining of the stomach. 
4. Less physical activity
Individuals who have sedentary lifestyles are more prone to develop GERD.
5. Postprandial physical activity
Strenuous physical activity such as running and weight lifting immediately after having food also increases the chances of GERD.
6. Obesity
Obese people have increased intra-abdominal pressure, delayed emptying of food from the stomach, and decreased LES pressure which triggers GERD. 
Studies also suggest that central obesity (measured as the waist-to-hip ratio) makes the individual more prone to GERD complications. 
7. Stress
Stress is linked to increased acid secretion in the stomach.Explore the stress-relieving products from your cart.Add to cart
8. Hiatal hernia 
It is a condition in which the stomach bulges through the large muscle separating your abdomen and chest (diaphragm). People with this condition are more likely to develop GERD and its complications.
9. Connective tissue disorders
Individuals with connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and scleroderma are also at a high risk of developing GERD. 
10. Certain Medications 
The use of certain medications is also associated with GERD. The class of medications that may cause GERD to develop are:


Benzodiazepines


Calcium channel blockers (antihypertensive medications)


Asthma medications


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs)


Antidepressants


11. Pregnancy 
The fluctuations in hormones increase the risk of reflux of gastric contents in pregnancy. The majority of pregnant women tend to develop GERD.Are you on your family's way? Here is a list of medical tests that are a must during pregnancy. Tap to know",,"Specialist To Visit 
In most cases, the symptoms of GERD are occasional and may resolve through lifestyle changes or over-the-counter medications. It is advised to consult a healthcare professional if symptoms persist continuously for more than a week.
The other symptoms that need immediate medical consult include:


Heartburn even after taking (OTC) medications


Disturbed sleep due to nighttime reflux


Unexplained weight loss




Chronic hoarseness or wheezing


Specialists you should visit include the following:

The primary goal of treatment is to manage the symptoms and prevent complications.
The primary treatment approach is lifestyle modification. 
The following treatment options are recommended in individuals who do not respond to lifestyle modifications such as having smaller meals, avoiding spicy foods, and sticking to a meal routine. 
I. Medications
1. Antacids: These medications are used to relieve heartburn by neutralizing acid. They are readily available in liquid and chewable tablets as an OTC product. The common examples include:


magnesium carbonate


magnesium trisilicate


calcium carbonate


sodium bicarbonate


 
Order Antacids
2. Antihistamines (H2 receptor antagonist): These drugs inhibit the secretion of acid in the stomach. The bedtime administration of these drugs is recommended in persons having symptoms of GERD at night. 
Common examples are:


Famotidine 


Cimetidine


3. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): These drugs also reduce the production of acid. PPIs are also known to heal the damaged esophageal lining. They can be safely given for long-term treatment of GERD. The common PPIs used are:


Omeprazole


Lansoprazole


Esomeprazole


Pantoprazole


Rabeprazole


4. Prokinetic agents: A prokinetic agent is a type of drug that enhances gastrointestinal motility. This helps in reducing the symptoms of GERD. Examples are:


Metoclopramide 


Domperidone


II. Endoluminal therapy
This involves the delivery of radiofrequency energy to the LES. It creates a mechanical barrier that prevents the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus.
III. Surgery
Surgery is required in the following cases:


Refractory GERD (persistence of GERD even in the absence of symptoms)


Non-adherence to medications


Presence of large hiatal hernia


The available surgical options for GERD are:1. Fundoplication: It is the most commonly performed surgery for GERD.  In this surgery, the top of the stomach is sewn around the end of the esophagus. This adds pressure to the LES and helps in preventing reflux.  2. Bariatric surgery: It is a surgery in which slight modifications are done in the digestive system which helps in reducing weight. It is recommended in obese individuals with severe GERD symptoms. There are three commonly performed surgeries:


Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)


Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGP)


Sleeve gastrectomy

",,"Home-care For GERD
1. Milk: Milk reduces heartburn by neutralizing acidity. It is always advised to choose low-fat milk as whole milk may contribute to heartburn.2. Ginger (adrak):  It is an excellent remedy for heartburn due to its anti-inflammatory properties. It can be consumed by boiling with a glass of water for a few minutes.3. Baking soda: It is also known for neutralizing acid. It can be taken by simply dissolving a teaspoon with a cup of water.4. Basil leaves (tulsi): These leaves relieve heartburn and help to soothe the stomach lining. It can be taken as a tea by boiling two to three basil leaves in boiling water.5. Coconut water: It is rich in fiber and protects the stomach lining from acid exposure. Individuals with heartburn are advised to consume at least two glasses of coconut water for symptomatic relief.6. Mint (pudina): The natural cooling properties of mint helps in curbing the symptoms of acid reflux. Boil the mint leaves and have the brew to control GERD.7. Aloe vera: It has anti-inflammatory properties. Take some pure aloe vera juice, mix it with water, and consume it two to three times per day.8. Watermelon: Watermelon juice naturally relieves heartburn due to its alkaline nature.9. Banana: Banana is a low-acid fruit that is known to be beneficial for people suffering from acid reflux. It works by acting as a layer to the irritated esophageal lining to prevent acidity.","Complications Of GERD

Persistent acid reflux over a very long period of time may lead to the following complications:


Esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus) 


Stricture (abnormal narrowing of the esophageal lumen)

",,"Causes Of Gestational Diabetes

Diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose levels in the blood. Normally, the level of glucose is maintained by a hormone called insulin. Insulin helps in the utilization of the glucose. During pregnancy, the sensitivity of insulin is reduced by about 56% via: 



Placental hormones: Such as human placental lactogen (hPL), human placental growth hormone (hPGH), growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL), estrogens, and gestagens. 


Inflammatory chemicals: Such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-6, resistin, and C-reactive protein (CRP).


Glucose: Produced by the body for the fetus. Studies suggest that endogenous glucose production is increased by 30% in the third trimester of pregnancy. 



In most cases, adaptation occurs in the body by increasing the secretion of insulin. But, gestational diabetes happens if insulin secretion is not able to withstand the demand.

9. Previous history of GDM
Studies suggest that women who have a prior history of gestational diabetes are six times more prone to it in the next pregnancy. 
10. Family history
The history of diabetes in the first-line relatives of the women also makes the woman more prone to gestational diabetes. 
11. High-risk race or ethnicity 
Women that belong to particular races are more prone to gestational diabetes. These include African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian.
12. History of delivery of infant >4000 gms
Women who have previously birthed an infant weighing 4000 grams or more have more chances of developing gestational diabetes in the next pregnancy. 

13. Season

Recent studies suggest that the chance of getting gestational diabetes is more in summer.
14.  In vitro fertilization (IVF)
There is a 50% increase in diabetes in pregnancy that results from in vitro fertilization (IVF), where the joining of a woman's egg and a man's sperm happens in a laboratory setting.

15. Other medical conditions
The presence of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in women is also a risk factor for diabetes during pregnancy. ",,"Prevention Of Gestational Diabetes

Gestational diabetes is not completely preventable but some measures can lower the risk of the same. These include:
1. Go for pre-pregnancy counselling
It consists of a complete assessment of diabetes and associated complications to check the possibility of any medical condition during pregnancy. This will help to start the treatment plan even before pregnancy.

3. Keep a check on your weight
Women who gain a lot of weight during pregnancy are more likely to develop gestational diabetes. Most of us think that putting on weight is very common during pregnancy. But there are some recommendations regarding weight gain: 


For women who were underweight before pregnancy (BMI of less than 18.5): 12.5 to 18 kilograms of weight gain during pregnancy.


For women with an average weight before pregnancy (BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9):11.5 to 16 kilograms of weight gain during pregnancy.


For women who were overweight before pregnancy (BMI of between 25 and 29.9): 7 to 11.5 kilograms of weight gain during pregnancy.


For women who were obese before pregnancy (BMI greater than 30): 5 to 9 kilograms of weight gain during pregnancy.

Comprehensive care is very essential for the management of gestational diabetes. Diet and exercise are the pillars to manage it and medications are used in case of no response to these. The treatment includes:

1. Nutritional therapy
The management of gestational diabetes starts with modifications in the diet. The diet plan should be customized for each individual. It is highly advisable to consult a nutritionist. The meal should contain an appropriate amount of carbohydrate, fats, and proteins considering the health of the fetus. The eating plan created by the doctor/dietitian should always be followed which usually include:


Bedtime eating to prevent the development of ketosis overnight
5 Frequent meals– three small to moderate sized meals and 2-3 snacks to maintain optimum blood glucose level
Cultural preferences of the women to promote adherence
Proteins to avoid hunger



Foods to eat

Healthy fats from nuts, olive oil, fish oils, flax seeds, or avocados
Fruits and vegetables—ideally fresh, the more colorful the better; whole fruit rather than juices
High-fiber cereals and breads made from whole grains
High-quality proteins such as eggs, beans, low-fat dairy, and unsweetened yogurt


Foods to avoid

Trans fats or deep-fried foods
Packaged and fast foods, especially those high in sugar, baked goods, sweets, chips, desserts
White bread, sugary cereals, refined pastas 
Processed meat and red meat
Low-fat products that have replaced fat with added sugar, such as fat-free yogurt


2. Exercise
It plays a very important role in maintaining optimum blood glucose. The activities that can be included in the regimen are:

Walking
Swimming
Selected pilates
Low-intensity fitness exercises. 


Studies have shown that 20–30 min of activity 3–4 times a week has significantly reduced fasting and postprandial glucose. However, the exercise regimen should always be discussed with the doctor considering the safety of the baby. 
Here is a detailed video on the types of activities that can be safely performed during pregnancy.
3. Insulin
The injection of insulin is recommended when the individual is unable to achieve optimal glucose level even with diet and exercise. It is the first-line drug for gestational diabetes due to its safety and effectiveness. The dosage is based on the weight of the mother. 

The injection of insulin is self-administered by the patient. The insulin is usually taken in two halves – one half is taken at bedtime and the other half is divided between three meals. The injection is administered before meals to prevent the abrupt rise in glucose.

4. Metformin -  A new and safe prospect in managing gestational diabetes??
For several decades, insulin has been the most reliable treatment and the gold standard in the management of gestational diabetes. 
Metformin is an effective oral hypoglycemic drug and an established first-line treatment in type 2 diabetes currently. 

As it crosses the placenta, a safety issue remains an obstacle and, therefore, metformin is currently not recommended in the treatment of gestational diabetes. 

Nevertheless, recent research has supported metformin for its equivalent safety and efficacy compared to insulin along with the following reasons:


Ease of its use


Acceptability by the patients


Significantly less maternal weight gain


Less maternal hypoglycemia


Reduction in the complications associated with GDM such as preterm delivery, early pregnancy loss, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

5. Management of labor
Gestational diabetes can impact the time and type of delivery. It is very important to manage blood glucose during labor to avoid maternal and fetal complications.

Routine glucose monitoring at least 4 times a day is essential to track glucose fluctuations. It includes daily monitoring of fasting glucose and 1 or 2 hours after each meal. The level of glucose after meals helps to assess maternal and fetal complications. The frequency of monitoring is less in women whose glucose is diet controlled.

 ","Home-care For Gestational Diabetes
Along with exercise and diet, there are certain kitchen ingredients that have shown good results in the management of gestational diabetes:



Vitamin C rich foods: Studies have shown that consuming approximately 600 mg of Vitamin C helps in alleviating blood glucose. Women with gestational diabetes are advised to include Vitamin C-rich foods in their diet. Common examples of such food items that can be safely used during pregnancy are tomatoes, oranges, blueberries, strawberries, kiwis, and grapes. 





Indian gooseberry (Amla) is also a good source of Vitamin C that helps to control blood sugar levels. It makes the body more responsive to insulin.

Fenugreek (Methi): It is known to keep diabetes in check while improving glucose tolerance, lowering blood sugar levels, and stimulating the secretion of insulin. It is always available in the Indian kitchen and can be easily included in the daily diet. 





Drumstick (Moringa): It is rich in antioxidants and Vitamin C along with its anti-diabetic property. It can be consumed by sipping the water boiled with its pieces. It can also be added to the daal or curry. 





Cinnamon (Dalchini): It is known to control blood glucose levels due to the presence of a bioactive compound that regulates insulin activity. It can be taken with warm water. However, it should be taken in moderation as it can stimulate involuntary contractions during pregnancy. It is always better to consult your healthcare provider before starting it.

","Complications Of Gestational Diabetes

The blood glucose usually returns to normal after the delivery of the baby. But, some women can develop type 2 diabetes later in their lives. The poor glucose control during pregnancy can lead to:
1. Spontaneous abortion 
The women who have persistently high blood glucose during pregnancy are at high risk of early miscarriage. 

2. Unexplained stillbirths
Miscarriages that happen after the 20th week of pregnancy are termed as stillbirths. Uncontrolled blood glucose over a long period of time can cause stillbirths. The excessive production of lactic acid as a result of diabetes can also cause fetal death. 
3. Preterm delivery
Gestational diabetes can cause preterm labor before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Babies born this early might suffer from long-term intellectual and developmental problems. 

4. Cesarean delivery
Diabetes in pregnancy increases the chances of cesarean delivery due to a large baby.

The other complications can be categorized as:
1. Maternal complications


Preeclampsia


Type 2 diabetes


Diabetic ketoacidosis (Formation of ketones bodies)


Severe hypoglycemia (Low blood sugar levels)


Diabetic nephropathy (Damage to the blood vessels of the kidneys)


Diabetic neuropathy (Nerve damage)


Diabetic retinopathy (Damage to the blood vessels of the eye).



2. Fetal complications



Macrosomia (Large fetus weighing about 4000 gms to 4500 gms). 


Hypoglycemia (Severe drop in blood glucose)


Polycythemia (High number of red blood cells)


Shoulder dystocia (failure to deliver the fetal shoulders during vaginal delivery)


Hyperbilirubinemia (High levels of bilirubin in the blood)


Respiratory distress (Difficulty in breathing)


Hypocalcemia (Low level of calcium)


Type 2 diabetes later in life

","Alternative Therapies For Gestational diabetes

Some alternative therapies have shown promise in the management of gestational diabetes. However, it is crucial to consult the doctor before initiating any of them. 

1. Chinese herbal medicine
It includes several medicines that are prepared from plant products such as leaves, stems, flowers, roots, and seeds. Studies show that Chinese herbal medicines can be used in the management of gestational diabetes.

2. Yoga
Yoga plays a very important role in controlling blood sugar levels. It also keeps stress under control and helps in balancing the other vital parameters along with aiding in building strength, endurance capacity, and flexibility of the mother. "

Differences and similarities between swine flu and the common cold

Swine flu and the common cold are both contagious respiratory tract illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. They have a lot of similarities and it becomes difficult to distinguish between them. Some of the most common similarities and differences include:
 
1. Symptoms
Similarity: The symptoms of cold and flu are very similar at the onset with a runny nose, headache, fatigue, and difficulty in breathing.
Difference: Cold symptoms are usually milder than the symptoms of swine flu and it generally does not result in serious health problems.

2. Cause
Similarity: Both cold and influenza are caused by viruses.
Difference: Swine flu is caused by the H1N1 influenza virus. Whereas the common cold can be caused by a number of other viruses, including rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, and seasonal coronaviruses.

3. Incubation period
Similarity: Both diseases are highly contagious and have an incubation period (the period between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms) of a minimum of 1 day before the individual starts experiencing symptoms.
Difference: The incubation period for influenza is usually 1-4 days and 1-7 days for colds.

4. Duration of illness
Similarity: Swine flu and the common cold cause respiratory tract illnesses ranging from 4 days to two weeks.
Difference: A cold's duration (how long it lasts) is about 7 to 10 days; however, depending upon the viral strain, it can last up to two weeks. The swine flu's duration varies from about 5 days to two weeks with an average of 8 days.

5. Risk factors
Similarity: Both have similar risk factors i.e. younger children, old people, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals are at a higher risk.
Difference: Individuals who do not receive the swine flu vaccine are more likely to risk getting infected with the flu virus but there is no vaccination to prevent the common cold.

Differences and similarities between swine flu and COVID-19


Swine flu and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory infections of the respiratory system but are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by an infection with a coronavirus (first identified in 2019). And swine flu is caused by the H1N1 virus. They are both quite similar yet different, some of the common similarities and differences between them include:

1. Duration of illness
Similarity: It is two days on average before an infected person starts experiencing the symptoms of illness.
Difference: COVID-19 may take a longer duration for the symptoms to start whereas, in the case of flu, the symptoms begin between 1-4 days.

2. Mode of the spread
Similarity: Both COVID-19 and swine flu can spread from person to person between people who are in close contact with one another i.e. within about 6 feet through droplets from sneezing, coughing, or talking.
Difference: COVID-19 is generally more contagious than the swine flu virus.

3. Risk factors
Similarity: Older adults, individuals with certain underlying medical conditions, pregnant women, and children are at higher risk of getting both COVID-19 and swine flu.
Difference: COVID-19 seems to cause more serious illnesses in some people resulting in hospitalization and death can occur even in healthy people.

4. Complications
Similarity: Respiratory complications occur in patients infected with swine flu and COVID-19.
Difference: Most people with swine flu can recover on their own in a few days to two weeks whereas COVID-19 complications can happen even after the recovery (long covid syndrome).

The only trusted way to know for sure, if your symptoms are that of the flu or COVID is to get tested. Do not neglect your symptoms thinking it's just the flu.

Differences and similarities between swine flu and seasonal influenza

Regular flu or influenza may be caused by RNA viruses belonging to the family Orthomxoviridae. Swine flu is caused by a family of viruses that affects pigs. Some of the similarities and differences between them include: 

1. Cause
Similarity: Both swine flu and influenza are caused by viruses.
Difference: The strains that cause Influenza viruses A, B, and C. The known strains that cause swine flu include subtypes of influenza also known as H1N1.

2. Symptoms
Similarity: Both present with similar symptoms that include fever, chills, sore throat, body ache, headache, coughing, and fatigue. 
Difference: In swine flu, some people may experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea or diarrhea. This is thought to be one of the ways it differs from seasonal flu.

3. Incubation period
Similarity: Symptoms for both begin after about two days from the contraction of the virus.
Difference: The known incubation period for H1N1 swine flu ranges from 1 to 4 days, but for some individuals, it may be as long as 7 days. In the case of seasonal flu, symptoms typically begin about two days but can range from 1-4, after flu viruses infect the respiratory tract.

4. Mode of transmission
Similarity: Both spread through droplets of nuclei from an infected person.
Difference: The virus is transmitted through larger droplets in the case of swine flu, and infection can spread from an infected animal to humans.

A physical exam is done to look for symptoms of H1N1. There are many tests used to diagnose influenza. But not everyone who has the flu needs to be tested. A diagnosis of confirmed swine flu requires laboratory testing of a respiratory sample (a simple nose and throat swab). The tests include:

1. Real-time PCR
This test is used to detect seasonal influenza A, B, H1, H3, and avian H5 serotypes. The test is done by collecting samples from the throat and nose of the suspected individual. It provides an accurate and rapid diagnosis of swine flu.

2. Nucleotide sequencing
It refers to the general laboratory technique for determining the exact sequence of nucleotides, or bases, in a DNA molecule. It is helpful in determining the H1N1 strain.
 
3. Phylogenetic analysis
It is done to isolate the gene from the pigs. This test is indicated to determine the exact strain of swine flu.

Prevention and control measures for swine influenza are based on understanding how the disease is transmitted. Preventive measures include

1. Prevention of pig-to-human transmission
The transmission between pigs and humans mainly occurs in swine farms where farmers are in close contact with live pigs. Measures to prevent it include vaccines for swine to prevent their infection. Avoiding smoking near the infected animal, and wearing gloves while handling them can decrease infections to a larger extent.

2. Prevention of human-to-human transmission
This virus is not transmitted through food. In humans, it is most contagious during the first 5 days of the illness. However, children can remain contagious for up to 10 days. Recommendations to prevent the spread of the virus among humans include:

a. Take quarantine seriously: The close contacts of the suspected, probable, and confirmed swine cases are advised to remain at home and avoid traveling for at least 7 days. In case of any symptoms, the contacts should undergo a prompt test for H1N1 influenza and consult a physician. 

b. Follow cough and hand hygiene: 

Hands must be frequently washed with soap and water or alcohol-based or antiseptic handwash or hand rub.
The infected persons should cover their nose and mouth with a single-use tissue while coughing or sneezing
The used tissue must be disposed of immediately
The healthcare workers who are involved in the direct care of patients with confirmed or suspected swine should use gowns, eye protection, gloves, and disposable N95 respirators.


c. Give importance to chemo-prophylaxis: Antiviral medicines can be used for prophylaxis (to prevent) contact with the patient with a high risk for complications and the healthcare personnel. Oseltamivir is given once a day until 10 days after the individual’s last contact with the patient and can be given for a maximum of 6 weeks.

d. Get vaccinated: WHO recommends vaccination of all the healthcare staff coming in contact with the suspected or confirmed cases of swine flu (physicians, nurses, paramedical, and ambulance staff). This vaccine against influenza A/H1N1 can be taken yearly. The immune response of the body takes about 2-3 weeks to develop after vaccination.

e. Other general measures

Early self-isolation of those feeling unwell or have symptoms
Avoid close contact with sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth
Disinfect surfaces that have come in contact with the infected person
Cook red meat at 1600F (700C) to kill the virus.
Disinfect used tissues before discarding them.


Keep this in mind!
Children and teenagers recovering from flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. This is due to the risk of Reye syndrome, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition.

Listen to our experts talk how viruses spread and about effective ways to prevent it.

","Causes Of Hair Loss

Before knowing about the causes of hair loss, let’s know about the hair growth and hair loss cycle. 
Ideally, each hair follicle goes through three phases:
1. Anagen phase is the active phase of hair growth that usually lasts for about two to six years. Around 85-90% of the hair on the scalp is in this stage at a given point in time.
2. Catagen phase is the transitional phase that lasts a few weeks (2-3 weeks). Only 1% of hair is in this stage.
3. Telogen phase is the end phase of hair growth, which is the resting phase. Around 13% of our hair is in this stage.
At the end of the telogen phase, hair follicles are shed, which is replaced by new hair and the cycle continues. However, the hair growth cycle can be influenced by an individual’s age, diseases, hair care routine, and diet. 
Common causes of hair loss include:
Age: With age, it is common to notice some amount of hair fall. Men and women both notice receding hairline as well as thinning of hair.
Genetics: Hereditary causes are the most common cause of hair loss all over the world and both men and women are affected. It is also known as androgenic alopecia, male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness. It appears as a receding hairline and bald spots in men and thinning hair along the crown and a widening part in women.
Childbirth and other stressors: If you have recently given birth, or have had a chronic illness it can lead to hair fall. Stress or any kind of traumatic event may also trigger hair loss. 
Ongoing treatment/medications: Certain undergoing treatment such as treatment for cancer, arthritis, depression, heart problems, gout and high blood pressure can trigger hair fall within a few days or weeks of starting the radiation or chemotherapy. 
Tight hairstyles: Tight hairstyles such as braids can lead to hair fall over time. This is permanent hair loss and is known as traction alopecia. 
Scalp infections: A scalp infection, which appears as scaly and inflamed results in hair loss. 
Hormonal imbalance: Certain women experience hair loss due to hormonal imbalances in conditions such as PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). Birth control pills, which are hormonal preparations, can also trigger hair fall.
Nutritional deficiencies: If your diet lacks protein, zinc, biotin, iron or any other essential nutrient then you may notice hair fall and thinning of hair. 
Disease: Diseases such as hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, diabetes, lupus and STI’s (sexually transmitted infections) can lead to hair fall as well as bald patches on the eyebrows, lashes, and other parts of the body.
Pulling your own hair: Also known as Trichotillomania, it is the habit of pulling one’s own hair that may lead to permanent hair loss over time. ","Symptoms Of Hair Loss

Signs and symptoms of hair loss can present in many ways as the following:


Gradual loss or thinning of hair on top of head.




Receding hairline(frontal fibrosing alopecia). If the hairline starts looking higher than the usual position.




Widening partition. If someone parts their hair, they might notice the part getting wider over time.


Circular or bald patches. Some people develop circular or bald patches on their scalp, beard or eyebrows.


Loosening  of hair. Clumps of hair might come out while combing or washing hair.


Thinner ponytail.


Scalp starts getting visible through the hair.


Full-body hair loss. Some health conditions and treatments such as chemotherapy for cancer, can cause loss of hair from all over the body.


Hair loss can be gradual or rapid. The symptoms for gradual hair loss include hair thinning, widening of part, receding hairline. The symptoms for rapid hair loss include clumps of hair in comb or drain, a bald patch that appeared recently and severe hair fall.
Note: Gradual hair loss is more common and tends to affect everybody at least once in their lifetime. The signs of gradual hair loss are subtle and may take a long time before you even notice your hair fall!
Apart from the obvious signs of hair fall, some other symptoms may also be present with your hair fall. 


Intense itching and redness in the scalp: This could occur due to an underlying infection in the scalp.


Scaly bald patches, often with sores: It can be a sign of fungal infection like ringworm or due to a chronic disease like psoriasis. 


Burning and tingling on the scalp: Some people who have alopecia areata experience might experience burning and stinging prior to sudden hair loss.


Pus-filled sores on the scalp: Some conditions such as folliculitis can cause pus-filled blisters on the scalp resulting in temporary hair loss.

","Types Of Hair Loss

Hair loss, also known as alopecia, is broadly classified into cicatricial alopecia and non-cicatricial alopecia. In non-cicatricial alopecia, hair loss is not permanent whereas in cicatricial alopecia, scars occur along with hair fall and destroy the hair follicle resulting in permanent hair loss. A few types of hair loss are discussed below:
1. Non-cicatricial or Non-scarring alopecia


Androgenic alopecia: Androgenic alopecia is also called hereditary hair loss. In men, it is known as male pattern baldness which is characterised by gradual loss of hair above the temples and thinning at the top of the head, usually creating a shape of ‘M’. In women, it is known as the female pattern baldness and results in thinning all over the scalp or widening of the part.


Alopecia areata:  It is an autoimmune disorder in which the body starts to attack its own hair follicles. This is hair loss that can affect every part of the body, including the scalp, face, trunk, and extremities. When it affects only a portion of the body, it is called alopecia areata. When it affects an entire site it is called alopecia totalis. When it involves the whole body, it is called alopecia universalis which is mostly associated with conditions like vitiligo and thyroid disorders. 


Anagen effluvium: In this, diffuse and rapid hair loss occurs, which is mainly caused by the effect of radiation and chemotherapy. Hair usually grow back after completion of the treatment.


Telogen effluvium: It is a type of sudden diffuse hair fall that is mostly seen after some stressful event, period of emotional shock , illnesses or taking certain medications. It can also occur due to hormonal fluctuations that happen in pregnancy, childbirth, starting or stopping hormonal birth control pills or menopause.


Traction alopecia: This type of alopecia results from too much pressure on the hair, mostly because of tight braids, ponytails, or buns.


Trichotillomania: In this type of impulse control disorder, a person pulls his/her own hair subconsciously. This leads to irregular bald patches and uneven hair length. It mostly occurs in children or adolescents. In children, it is more like a habit that will eventually resolve on its own, but in adolescents, psychiatric help might be required.



2. Cicatricial alopecia or scarring alopecia

Cicatricial alopecia is a broad umbrella encompassing uncommon inflammatory hair loss disorders that result in scarring patches of hair loss with absence of hair follicles. Causes of hair follicle destruction include fungal infections, chemicals such as hair relaxers, and inflammatory disorders which include discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris, dissecting cellulitis, tufted folliculitis, folliculitis decalvans, alopecia mucinosa, alopecia neoplastica, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, and acne keloidalis.","Risk Factors For Hair Loss

There are many risk factors for developing hair loss. Some of these risk factors can be avoided, while others cannot. The following are some of the risk factors:


Hereditary: If you have a family history of hair loss, then there is a good chance that you will experience it also. Hereditary hair loss can affect both men and women.




Stress: A person who is frequently experiencing stress can be a risk factor for hair loss. Stress of all kinds can cause a negative effect on the body. It can cause the hair to stop growing.




Hormonal changes: Hormonal changes that happen in pregnancy, childbirth, starting or stopping hormonal birth control pills or menopause can also increase the risk of hair loss.




Medications: Certain medications may lead to hair loss. If you begin to experience hair loss after the beginning of a medication, talk to your doctor to check if this is a side effect of your medication.




Chemotherapy: During the treatment for cancer, there is a good chance of losing hair. The hair will begin to grow back after the series of chemotherapy treatments is done.

There are many treatment options for hair loss right from the use of medications to hair transplantation. These are:

A. Medications

1. Oral supplements


Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin): This vitamin is responsible for the production of red blood cells, which deliver oxygen and essential nutrients to all parts of your body, including hair follicles. 


Vitamin B7 (Biotin): This vitamin is known to stimulate keratin production in hair and can increase the rate of follicle growth. Supplements of Vitamin B12 are beneficial for regrowing hair in people with its deficiency. 


Zinc: Zinc is an essential mineral that’s involved in several biological processes within your body. It plays a key role in making proteins in your hair and other cells. 


Iron: The best way to treat hair loss with ferritin is to increase your iron levels. Hair loss as a result of low iron is not permanent and it can be treated with supplements and foods rich in iron. 


2. MinoxidilIt is an over-the-counter medication that is FDA approved for use in both men and women. Administered topically, the 5 % concentration is used to treat male pattern baldness whereas 2% is only approved for female pattern baldness treatment. It stops the thinning of hair and is known to stimulate hair growth.3. Finasteride
It is also an FDA-approved drug for the medical management of hair loss but only in men. It is a prescription drug that is commonly used to treat an enlarged prostate, but a higher dose is used to treat hair fall. It stops the production of the hormone 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), excess of which is known to cause hair loss.4. Topical corticosteroids or steroid injections
These are steroids that help to stop inflammation and treat hair loss. This usually comes in the form of topical cream or injection that needs to be injected into the scalp to promote hair growth. These injections are usually given every 4 to 8 weeks as needed. Talk to your dermatologist to know about it.
B. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) therapy
PRP is a process in which the patient's own blood is processed and injected into different points in the scalp. PRP, which is rich in growth factors helps in hair growth. The following steps are followed:Step 1 - The blood is drawn usually from the arm and processed in a centrifuge (a machine that spins and separates fluids of different densities).
Step 2 - After about 10 minutes in the centrifuge, the blood separates into three layers:


platelet-poor plasma


platelet-rich plasma


red blood cells


Step 3 - The scalp is locally anesthetized. The platelet-rich plasma is drawn up into a syringe and injected into areas of the scalp that require more hair growth.
 
C. Hair transplantation
During a hair transplant procedure, a dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon removes hair from a part of the head that has hair and transplants it to a bald spot. Possible risks include bleeding, bruising, swelling and infection. Follicular unit extraction (FUE) and follicular unit transplantation (FUT) are the two most common techniques for hair transplants. Talk to your dermatologist to know which procedure best suits your condition.
1. Follicular Unit Transplantation or FUTFUT is the older of the two methods and uses strips of skin with hair on them from your scalp itself to be transplanted in a bald spot. The scarring left behind on the donor site is covered up with new hair. This technique requires much aftercare and is quite a hassle to go through. 
2. Follicular Unit Extraction or FUEIt is a newer technique and is sufficiently advanced in the technology it uses to get the result. In this method, incisions are made around every follicle unit, which is then transplanted to the balding area. This method leads to very little scarring, and the recovery process takes a lot less time compared to FUT.
D. Laser treatment
There is numerous laser equipment available in the market which claims to stimulate hair growth and treat hair fall. These include brushes, combs, and other electronic devices, however, the efficiency and safety of these devices are not known.",,"Home- care For Hair Loss

1. Onion (pyaaz) juice

Onions contain sulfur, which is needed for the production of amino acids, proteins, and collagen, which in turn are needed for hair growth and prevent hair loss. Applying onion juice on the scalp is known to increase blood supply to hair follicles and thus, prevent hair fall due to hair thinning and promote hair growth. 

2. Eggs
Eating eggs can be beneficial for hair growth and prevent hair loss because eggs are loaded with nutrients like biotin, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and folate, which are proved to aid in hair growth and prevent hair loss caused due to nutritional deficiency.

3. Aloe vera

This traditional home remedy is known to soothe the scalp, condition dry hair, and reduce dandruff along with nourishing the hair follicles and improve overall hair health when rubbed over the scalp and length of the hair.

4. Coconut (nariyal) oil
Coconut oil improves hair health and luster. This is because it contains lauric acid, which penetrates easily into the hair shaft and thus, reduces protein loss from both damaged and undamaged hair when used as a pre and post-wash treatment.

5. Fenugreek (methi) seeds

Fenugreek seeds contain phytoestrogens (plant hormones) which were believed to enhance hair growth. 

6. Bhringraj
Eclipta alba (bhringraj) is one of the most popular and widely used traditional home remedies for hair fall. Methanolic extract of E.alba in water can promote hair growth by increasing the anagen-phase (the active growth phase of hair follicles).

7. Tea tree oil

Tea tree oil is one of the very few essential oils which are known to prevent hair fall and promote hair growth. It is due to its powerful cleaning, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. When applied topically it can improve the absorption of nutrients by the follicles and thus, enhance hair growth.","Complications Of Hair Loss

Hair loss or alopecia does not have any harmful physical effects as such but the psychological impact of hair loss cannot be denied. Anxiety and depression are some of the psychological consequences of alopecia that affect both genders. Interestingly, high levels of stress and anxiety further accentuate hair fall. Failure of treatment or its ineffectiveness also contributes to psychological conditions. "

","Symptoms Of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is mostly a childhood illness though it can affect adults also. The symptoms are usually the same in children and adults. But, the disease can be worse in infants and children due to their inability to express their symptoms.The disease is mild, resembling a common cold in the initial days of infection. In most cases, symptoms last for 7-10 days. As the name suggests, symptoms appear on the hand, foot and mouth in the form of sores, blisters and rashes. The typical symptoms of HFMD can be broadly classified as:
Fever and flu-like symptoms
These symptoms start appearing after 3 to 5 days of catching the virus. The symptoms include:


High fever


Sore throat


Tiredness


Loss of appetite 


Mouth ulcers
Children suffering from HFMD usually develop mouth sores after a few days of infection. Ulcers appear in the mouth and tongue which gradually progress into painful blisters. This makes swallowing difficult which can be identified by the following signs in children:


Not eating even his/her favorite food


Drooling (drooping saliva from mouth more than usual)


Crying while eating


Interest only in having cold fluids


Skin rashes
A child having HFMD gets rashes on the skin which look like slightly raised red spots. The spots can also look pink or darker skin depending upon the skin tone.
The most common sites of rashes are hands and feet, although they can also appear on the buttocks, legs, and arms.
In most of the cases, rashes do not cause itching. Sometimes, rashes develop into blisters which are filled with fluid containing viruses. 
Other symptoms
A child with HFMD might also experience


Muscles aches


Irritability 


Pain in abdomen


Diarrhea


Headache


Runny nose


Peeling of the skin


Tenderness or pain while touching the palms of the hands and soles of the feet


Vomiting


Here are some important things to remember when your child has one or multiple episodes of vomiting.
Read To Know
Signs of dehydration
The child suffering from HFMD can be dehydrated due to inability to drink anything which can be noticed as:


Dry mouth


Lack of tears


Sunken eyes


Dark urine


Decrease in the frequency of urination


No wet diapers for 4-6 hours (infants and toddlers)

",,"Causes Of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease
HFMD is a viral infection that is caused by enterovirus family which includes mainly three viruses:


Coxsackievirus A16: It is the most common cause of HFMD.


Coxsackievirus A6: It is associated with the severe form of infection.


Enterovirus 71 (EV-A71): It is rarely found but is associated with severe diseases such as encephalitis 


Transmission
The disease is highly contagious and can spread from one person to another through infected saliva, nasal secretions, fluid from blisters, and feces.
Usually, the chances of spreading the infection are high during the first 5 days of onset of symptoms. However, in some cases, infection can be spread even in the absence of symptoms or a little later due to the presence of virus in the stool for 4 to 8 weeks. 
Anyone can get the disease by: 


Contact with respiratory secretions during coughing or sneezing 


Making close contact with the infected person such as during kissing, hugging, etc.


Touching an infected person


Sharing contaminated objects with the infected person


Touching an infected person’s feces such as during changing diapers


Touching the contaminated objects and surfaces such as doorknobs and toys


Note: In rare cases, the virus of HFMD can also be transmitted by swallowing water in swimming pools. This can happen, if the water is contaminated with feces of the infected person. ",,,"Prevention Of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease
There is no vaccine for hand, foot, and mouth disease but it can be easily prevented by following some basic steps which include:


Hand washing


Since, HFMD is a contagious disease that can spread through touching, hand washing serves the best protection. Hands should be washed often with soap and water and children should be educated about the importance of hand hygiene. 
In case, soap and water are not available such as during traveling, alcohol based sanitizer can be used. Make sure to wash hands after:


Changing diapers


Using the toilet


Touching nose


Coughing and sneezing


Taking care of sick people




Cleaning and disinfection


The virus causing HFMD can live on surfaces for some time. It is advised to clean frequently touched surfaces and objects regularly such as toys, doorknobs, sippers, etc. Make sure to wash the soiled bedding and clothes with hot soap water. 


Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth


The infection can spread by touching eyes, nose, and mouth with contaminated hands. To reduce this, avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. 


Avoid close contact with infected person


The disease can spread through close contact with the infected person especially during kissing, hugging, etc.


Avoid sharing of articles


Since the virus can live on objects for a few days, avoid sharing toys, towels, or household items such as cups and utensils of your kid with anyone. The regular cleaning of the shared toys and books should be practiced in childcare centers. 


Stay off school or nursery


The spread of infection can be prevented by keeping kids home for a few days, especially if they have symptoms such as fever, blisters, or mouth ulcers. 


Use tissues 


Try not to cough or sneeze in the open air, always use tissue while doing the same. Make sure to dispose of the used tissues immediately to reduce the risk of infection.Note: Breastfeeding does not impact the incidence of hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Mothers do not need to stop breastfeeding to prevent transmission of disease.","Treatment Of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease
There is no specific treatment for HFMD and children usually recover within 7 to 10 days on their own. As HFMD is a viral disease, antibiotics are not effective in curing the infection. The measures are taken to reduce symptoms and to prevent dehydration. 
There are various studies that are going on to develop antiviral treatment against  enterovirus 71 induced hand, foot, and mouth disease because of its neurological complications. 
The following treatment regimen is used to treat HFMD:


Over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as paracetamol and ibuprofen are used to treat fever and pain caused by mouth sores.


The child does not want to have much fluids due to painful sores so proper hydration of the child should be maintained by making him/her to drink enough fluids. 


A mixture of liquid ibuprofen and diphenhydramine can be used to gargle to reduce the pain caused by the ulcers. 


Ribavirin, quinacrine, and amantadine are the off-label antiviral medications that are used in severe cases of enterovirus 71. 


As per some studies, an antiviral drug, acyclovir showed the reduction in fever and skin changes within 24 hours of administration.


In case of severe dehydration and neurological or cardiopulmonary complications, hospitalization is required. 



Note: Aspirin is not recommended in children since it is linked with a life threatning disorder called Reye’s syndrome which  is a rare and potentially fatal pediatric illness. The syndrome causes serious liver and brain damage. The disease typically presents as vomiting and confusion which can even lead to coma and death.
Tips to soothe sore throat


Throat lozenges and sprays that do not contain benzocaine can be used for children over 4 years of age. 


Liquid antacid can be used for rinsing after meals.


Garling with a mixture of warm water and salt is very effective in children over 6 years of age who are able to gargle without swallowing. 

","Home-care For Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease
Although the disease is mild and usually goes away on its own, the symptoms such as painful mouth sores make it very difficult for the child to eat and drink. This makes the child even more irritable and fussy. 
The parents of the sick child should understand that the child will not be able to eat much for at least 7 to 10 days. It is advised that parents should shift the child from solid to soft liquids. 
The following measures may help in faster recovery of the child:
Diet


Foods to include- The child should be encouraged to have fluids such as water, milk, coconut water to prevent dehydration. The cold and soft foods such as ice cream, yogurt, smoothies, shakes, mashed potatoes, oatmeal, eggs, and popsicles should be included in the diet as it will help in numbing the area. This will not only serve as a welcome treat for kids but also soothes the ulcers. 

Foods to avoid- The acidic food items (citrus juices, lemonade, sodas and tomato sauces) can irritate the mouth sores and hence should be avoided. It is recommended to avoid hot drinks and spicy foods as they can aggravate the pain caused by mouth sores. 

Cleaning of blisters
The blisters that usually appear on hands and feet should be kept clean through regular washing with soap and water. In case, the blisters rupture, they should be cleaned with an antibiotic ointment to prevent any infection.  
Avoidance of self medication
There are various OTC medications that can harm infants and young children. Avoid giving any medication without the paeditrician’s consent to your child.
Education
The child should be taught not to touch the rash and mouth ulcers and to sneeze or cough into a tissue or on his/her sleeve. Education of hand hygiene is equally important.
Staying at home
The day care centers and schools of the child should be informed that he/she is diagnosed with the HFMD. It is important to inform staff and parents so that they can watch symptoms in other children. The child should be kept at home until the full recovery of mouth sores and open blisters.
Breastfeeding
If your child is under one year old, continue to give either breastmilk, formula, or both. ",,"Complications Of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease
The disease is acute with mild symptoms. Most of the patients of HFMD recover within a few weeks and the infection rarely recurs or persists.  The complications from hand, foot, and mouth disease are rare and include: 
Dehydration
It is the most common complication associated with HFMD. Children often get dehydrated due to difficulty in swallowing as a result of painful mouth ulcers. Hence, it has to be made sure to maintain optimum hydration.

Persistent stomatitis
It refers to the inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. It is often associated with painful ulcers that limit intake of food. 
Aseptic (viral) meningitis
It refers to the inflammation of the layers of the brain due to viral infection. It is more common with enterovirus 71 infection. It is often characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. 
Fingernail and toenail loss
In very severe cases, people may start losing fingernail or toenail which is usually noticed after 2 months of having an infection. The nail usually grows back on its own. 
In severe cases of infection, HFMD can also cause:


Widespread rash


Enteritis (Infection of the gut)


Pneumonia


Myocarditis (inflammation of the muscle of the heart)


Pulmonary edema (accumulation of fluids in the lungs)


Cerebral ataxia (sudden, uncoordinated muscle movement due to injury to the brain)


Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)


Guillain-Barre syndrome (a rare disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves)


Intracranial hypertension (build-up of pressure around the brain)


Paralysis


Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Pregnancy
Although there is no potential risk to the baby and mother, the medical history of the patient can affect the situation. Pregnant women should contact the doctor as in rare cases, HFMD can lead to misscarriage during the first trimester due to persistent high temperature.
Note: HFMD can affect adults also. But, most infected adults do not seem to show any symptoms, they are, however, still contagious and can spread the virus to another person."

Gastrointestinal diseases
Many gastrointestinal diseases cause an upset stomach, such as -


GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease): It causes the contents of the stomach to hurl back into the esophagus and cause symptoms like heartburn and dyspepsia (indigestion).


Gastroparesis: It is a condition in which the stomach is not able to empty itself due to affected motility of the stomach. This leads to the sensation of fullness and bloating.


Irritable bowel syndrome: It is a condition that affects the absorption of food from the intestines and can cause indigestion.


Celiac disease: In this condition, the body abnormally reacts to gluten, a protein found in grains such as wheat and barley.


Malabsorption syndrome: It is a condition in which the small intestine is not able to absorb nutrients from the food and body.


Gastrointestinal infections: It can cause acute inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, known as gastritis or gastroenteritis. These may be caused by a variety of microorganisms. 


Chronic pancreatitis: It can often cause bloating, flatulence, and indigestion.


Gastric cancers: They are a rare condition but could be a probable cause of indigestion.


Medications
Certain medications like NSAID painkillers, antibiotics like fluoroquinolones  tetracycline, iron and potassium supplements, cardiovascular drugs like digitalis, etc., can irritate the gastric lining and cause hyperacidity, bloating, or indigestion.

Vasculitis can be differentiated based on the size of the blood vessels affected, falling into one of three general categories. They include:
Large vessel vasculitis
It affects the body’s large arteries, including the aorta (which transports oxygen-rich blood from your heart to the rest of your body). Following are the types of large vessel vasculitis:
1. Giant cell arteries (temporal arteries): It is generally found in adults older than age 50. It affects upper body parts including the head, temples, and neck.
2. Takayasu arteritis: This type of vasculitis affects the large artery and may cause inflammation, narrowing, or blockage of the arteries or weaken the lining of artery walls that may rupture or burst.
Medium vessel vasculitis
This category belongs to medium blood vessels. The following are the types of medium vessel vasculitis:
1. Kawasaki disease (KD): It is common in young children (under the age of 5). Inflammation in multiple arteries and veins of the body is seen. It affects lymph nodes, mucous membranes, and skin. It can lead to severe health problems such as heart damage, if not diagnosed and treated properly. 
2. Polyarteritis nodosa: It affects multiple blood vessels in different parts of the body, including the skin, heart, kidneys, muscles, and intestines. 
Small vessel vasculitis
As the name suggests, this type is characterized by inflammation and blockage of small arteries. Different types of small vessel vasculitis include:
1. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA): It causes inflammation of small blood vessels along with inflammation in the kidneys, lungs, and nerves, but also involves the skin and joints. 
2. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA): It is a rare condition that causes inflammation in small blood vessels, and it's more common in older individuals. 
3. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA): It is an extremely rare form of vasculitis that causes inflammation in small blood vessels, leading to restricted blood flow and potential organ damage if not treated. It primarily affects the respiratory system and is linked with asthma.
4. Immunoglobulin A (IgA): It is a type of vasculitis that can occur in people of all ages, but is more common in young children. It is caused by the accumulation of immunoglobulin A (an antibody) in small blood vessels. This leads to inflammation and bleeding and can affect various parts of the body such as the skin, joints, kidneys, or intestines.
5. Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV): It is an uncommon type of vasculitis that causes inflammation of small blood vessels that are linked to antibodies. It can lead to kidney damage and other health issues such as arthritis, lung problems, and eye inflammation.
Others
1. Behcet’s disease: This condition affects blood vessels of all sizes and including skin, kidney, heart, brain, and spinal cord. More common during the second and third decades of life.
2. Buerger disease: This is inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels. It causes a tightening, or a blockage, of the blood vessels in your feet and hands.","Causes Of Vasculitis
 
The exact cause of vasculitis is not yet known. However, it is believed that vasculitis happens when the immune system mistakenly attacks blood vessel cells as if they were foreign objects. This makes it an autoimmune disease. Certain types of vasculitis may be linked to a person's genetics as well. ","Diagnosis Of Vasculitis
Diagnosing vasculitis can be tricky as there are several types and the symptoms can overlap with those of other conditions. Your doctor will ask questions regarding your health and recent medication. They will also do a physical exam and various tests to determine the type of vasculitis or rule out other conditions that look like it. Diagnostic approaches includes:
Blood tests
Antibodies and certain types of blood cells can be signs of vasculitis. These blood tests include:


Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test: These tests can help determine whether inflammation is present or not. 


C-reactive protein (CRP) test: It is done to check chronic disease or severe infection. A higher CRP value can indicate a sign of acute inflammation in the body.


Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA): This blood test helps to determine whether ANCA is present in your bloodstream to check for any autoimmune activity.


Complement levels: This test is done to determine bacterial or viral infection as the cause of vasculitis. 


IgE levels: The IgE is an antibody, that the immune system produces to identify and eliminate harmful microorganisms.


Hepatitis panel: It is a blood test used to determine if a person has been infected with hepatitis A, B, or C viruses.


Antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies: This test is done to check for any kidney damage as a result of viral infection.


Antinuclear antibody (ANA): This helps to detect if there are autoimmune diseases.


Antiphospholipid antibodies (APL): This blood test indicates the occurrence of Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is an autoimmune disorder that causes abnormal blood clotting due to antibodies.


HIV test: To rule out HIV infections in individuals presenting with symptoms of vasculitis.


Urine dipstick and microscopic tests
A urine dipstick involves dipping a specially treated paper strip into a sample of your urine. These will help to detect the presence of blood and protein in the urine, which are the first signs of small vessel vasculitis in the kidneys (inflamed kidney).
Imaging tests 
These tests can help evaluate and confirm which blood vessels and organs are affected. They include:


X-ray


Angiography


Ultrasound scan


Electrocardiogram (EKG)


Electromyography (EMG)


Computed tomography (CT) scan


Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan


Biopsy
It is a minor surgical procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the affected area of your body. Your doctor then examines this sample of tissue under a microscope for certain signs of vasculitis. This procedure is helpful in evaluating the types of small vessel vasculitis and medium vessel vasculitis.
Molecular imaging
This is a growing area of research that visualizes, characterizes, and quantifies the processes taken in the body. This is a newer advancement in the imaging of vasculitis that includes:


Positron emission tomography: This test measures the function by looking at blood flow, metabolism, neurotransmitters, and drugs.


PET scan: This test is used in the diagnosis of large vessel vasculitis.

Note: The medicines used in the treatment of vasculitis often have to be taken for a long time and can have side effects. It is important to talk to your doctor about your medicines and their side effects.
Surgery
Vasculitis can sometimes cause an abnormal bulging of blood vessels called an aneurysm, which can be treated with surgery to prevent bursting. In more severe cases, surgery may be needed to repair damaged blood vessels and organs or even transplant organs. Surgical procedures include:


Plasmapheresis: It is done to reduce plasma antibody levels by removing and replacing blood plasma (liquid portion of blood). 

Bypass surgery: This may be helpful in restoring blood flow in certain areas affected by Buerger's disease.

Maintenance of remission
Corticosteroids are tapered to zero or to the lowest dose that can maintain remission. IV rituximab may also be used to maintain remission, but the optimal dosage and infusion interval have not been clearly established. Individuals with frequent relapses may need to take immunosuppressants indefinitely.","Home-care Of Vasculitis

","Types Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises two conditions (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) characterized by persistent inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, leading to eventual damage.
1. Ulcerative colitis 


It primarily affects the large intestine (colon) and the rectum. 


Only the innermost layer of the colon's lining is inflamed in ulcerative colitis. The ulcers that develop on the inner lining of the colon have a tendency to bleed and form pus.


Damaged areas in ulcerative colitis are continuous (rather than patchwork), commonly beginning in the rectum and expanding into the colon.


2. Crohn's disease


It can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the anus.


Inflammation in Crohn's disease can cause inflammation to spread through the various layers of the GI tract's walls.


Crohn's disease causes damaged tissues to form in patches close to healthy tissue.

","Symptoms Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
 

Diarrhea associated with blood or mucus
Constipation
The urgency to have a bowel movement 
Fecal incontinence (passing stool at unexpected times)
Stomach pain
Nausea and vomiting
Joint pain
Rashes, ulcers, and sores on the skin
Redness, pain in the eyes and blurred vision.
Painful sores in the mouth

 
Iron deficiency anemia is common in IBD.
Individuals who have IBD often experience iron deficiency anemia (IDA) as a result of ongoing blood loss along with hindered absorption of iron caused by inflammation in the tissues.
Listen to our expert talk about iron deficiency anemia.

",,,"Diagnosis Of Inflammatory Bowel Disease
 
A combination of tests and procedures will be required to help confirm an IBD diagnosis, that include:

1. Medical history and symptoms
It consists of checking the following:



If you have IBD (Crohn's or colitis) in your family, such as a grandmother, parent, sibling, or child,


If you smoke (past or present)


If you have had prior hospitalization or operation


If you are on any medications (for example, antibiotics and hormonal medications like oral contraceptives)


If you have other illnesses (for example, colorectal disease, celiac disease, and arthritis)


If you have had any prior infection with Clostridium difficile (C. difficile or C. diff)



2. Blood tests

Complete blood count (CBC): This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in your blood. Low red blood cell count (anemia) and elevated white blood cell count can indicate inflammation.
C-reactive protein (CRP): CRP is a marker of inflammation in the body. Elevated CRP levels in the blood suggest ongoing inflammation, which is common in IBD.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): It measures how quickly red blood cells settle at the bottom of a test tube. Higher rates can indicate inflammation.
Antibody tests: This test is used to differentiate between Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. It tests for antibodies like anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA).


3. Stool test
This analysis detects the presence of bacteria or parasites, particularly beneficial in excluding infections that contribute to persistent diarrhea. A type of stool test done particularly for IBD is
 


Fecal calprotectin: This stool test measures the presence of calprotectin, a protein released during inflammation. Elevated levels suggest intestinal inflammation and can help differentiate between IBD and other conditions.



4. Endoscopic procedures


Endoscopy, and colonoscopy: These are invasive tests in which a probe is inserted via the mouth (endoscopy) or the rectum (colonoscopy) to visualize the inner structures of the digestive tract in real-time. It provides IBD specialists with a direct look at the gastric mucosa of the intestinal tract.




Capsule endoscopy: In capsule endoscopy, a capsule is swallowed containing a tiny camera which then travels through your digestive system taking pictures and allowing the doctor to visualize inside the digestive tract.



5.  Imaging techniques


Abdominal X-ray: It is performed in suspected cases of IBD to visualize inflammation, structural changes, and complications in the intestines


Ultrasound: It can aid in diagnosing IBD by visualizing the intestines, detecting inflammation, and assessing complications without using radiation.


Barium X-rays and fluoroscopy: For the procedure, you will be requested to position yourself in front of an X-ray machine and ingest barium. The barium will enhance the visibility of your upper GI tract on the X-ray images to detect the changes.


CT scan : Computed tomography, employs a machine to capture a sequence of X-rays in order to create an image of the digestive tract to czech for signs of inflammation.


 Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE): MRE is a diagnostic imaging test that generates detailed pictures of your small intestine and helps in the diagnosis of IBD.



6. Biopsy
Bio[sies of the colon can be taken to confirm the diagnosis. This technique is very effective in diagnosing the disease and in differentiating the type of inflammation.

Note: A healthcare physician may recommend adding an additional therapy, known as combination therapy. It involves using multiple medications together to better control inflammation and manage symptoms.

3. Surgical treatment
Even with medicines, many people will need surgery to treat IBD (including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) 

a. Surgical treatments for Crohn's disease


Proctocolectomy and colectomy: Colectomy is a surgical treatment that removes part or all of the large intestine, also known as the colon. If the rectum has been affected by inflammation, a surgeon may remove it as well, a technique known as proctocolectomy. 

Stricturoplasty: It is a surgical procedure used when the intestines have strictures (narrowing). Instead of removing the restricted segment, the surgeon makes longitudinal incisions in the stricture and then stitches them. 


Limited bowel resection:  This normally entails removing only the affected bowel to relieve the problems caused by the diseased segment of the bowel.


Bowel diversion with an ostomy: This entails redirecting stool flow through the colon by cutting the intestine above the severely damaged bowel and bringing it to the skin surface via an ostomy (surgical procedure). 


b. Surgical treatments for ulcerative colitis



Proctocolectomy with end-ileostomy: This procedure removes the colon, rectum, and anus completely. It is mainly reserved for patients suffering from severe ulcerative colitis.





Total colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA): This procedure includes creating an internal pouch from a piece of the small intestine (ileum). The pouch is then attached to the anus, allowing bowel motions.





Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis: The large intestine is removed with a straight link between the end of the small bowel and the anus, with no pouch created.

","Symptoms Of Influenza
Each person may experience symptoms in a different manner. Though influenza is a respiratory disease, it can affect the entire body. Sometimes individuals may have trouble figuring out whether they have a common cold or the flu. There are differences between them like the symptoms of a cold usually come on more slowly and are less severe than symptoms of the flu. Colds rarely cause a fever or headaches. In the case of influenza people usually become very sick with most, or all, of the following symptoms:


Cough that becomes severe gradually


Extreme exhaustion or tiredness


Severe muscle aches and pains


Runny or stuffy nose


Occasional sneezing


Fatigue for several weeks


Headache


Loss of appetite


High fever with chills


Sore throat


Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)


Pale face with watery and red eyes


Fever and body aches usually last for 3 to 5 days, but cough and fatigue may last for 2 weeks or more. Know the difference between common cold and flu.Click To Know!
Similarities and differences between influenza and common cold
Influenza (flu) and the common cold are both contagious respiratory tract illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. They have a lot of similarities and it becomes difficult to distinguish between them. Some of the most common similarities and differences include:
1. Symptoms


Similarity: The symptoms of cold and flu are very similar at the onset with runny nose, headache, fatigue and difficulty in breathing.

Difference: Cold symptoms are usually milder than the symptoms of flu and it generally does not result in serious health problems.

2. Cause


Similarity: Both cold and influenza are caused by viruses.

Difference: Flu is caused by influenza viruses only, whereas the common cold can be caused by a number of other viruses, including rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, and seasonal coronaviruses.

3. Incubation period


Similarity: Both the diseases are highly contagious and have an incubation period (the period between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms) of minimum 1 day before the individual starts experiencing symptoms. 

Difference: The exact incubation period for influenza is 1-4 days and 1-7 days for cold.

4. Duration of illness


Similarity: Influenza and common cold cause respiratory tract illness ranging from 4 days to two weeks.

Difference: A cold's duration (how long it lasts) is about 7 to 10 days; however, depending upon the viral strain, it can last up to two weeks. The flu's duration varies from about 5 days to two weeks depending upon the severity of the infection.

5. Risk factors


Similarity: Both have similar risk factors i.e. younger children, old people, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals are at a higher risk.

Difference: Individuals who do not receive the yearly flu vaccine are more likely to risk getting infected with a flu virus but there is no vaccination to prevent against common cold.

It is important to know the difference between common cold and influenza (flu). Do not ignore the symptoms or take them lightly. Read more about how to know when your cold is more than a cold?Click Now!
Similarities and differences between influenza (flu) and COVID-19
Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory infections of the respiratory system but are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by an infection with a coronavirus (first identified in 2019). And influenza is caused by infection with a flu virus (influenza viruses). These two infections have caused havoc in the world. Let us look at some of the common similarities and differences between them:1. Duration of illness


Similarity: It takes 1 or more days before an infected person starts experiencing the  symptoms of illness.

Difference: COVID -19 may take a longer duration for the symptoms to start whereas in the case of flu the symptoms begin between 1-4 days.

2. Duration of the spread of the virus


Similarity: It is possible to spread the virus for at least 1 day before experiencing any symptoms.

Difference: If a person has COVID-19, they could be contagious for a longer time than if they have flu (7 days).

3. Mode of the spread


Similarity: Both COVID-19 and flu can spread from person to person between people who are in close contact with one another i.e within about 6 feet through droplets from sneezing, coughing, or talking.

Difference: Though the virus that causes COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, COVID-19 is generally more contagious than flu viruses.

4. Individuals at risk


Similarity: Both COVID-19 and flu illness can result in severe illness and complications in older adults, individuals with certain underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women.

Difference: COVID-19 seems to cause more serious illnesses in some people resulting in hospitalization and death can occur even in healthy people.

5. Complications


Similarity: Respiratory complications occur in patients infected with influenza or COVID -19.

Difference: Most people who get flu will recover on their own in a few days to two weeks whereas COVID -19 complications can happen even after the recovery (long covid syndrome).

COVID- 19 is here to stay, but we need to adapt to it and get accustomed to the “new normal”. Read more about the FAQs on COVID- 19.Click Here!","Causes Of Influenza

Influenza viruses belong to the family of viruses called “Orthomyxoviridae”, an RNA-type virus. Viruses have spherical or filamentous shapes with an envelope, containing glycoproteins and a single-stranded RNA gene. The 2 most important glycoproteins over the outer layer of the flu virus are hemagglutinin (H, or HA) and neuraminidase (N, or NA). Both of them have important roles in the spread of the disease.The influenza viruses are divided into 3 main types i.e A, B, and C. Most of the epidemics (a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time) and outbreaks of flu are caused most commonly by types A and B, with type C being generally responsible for sporadic mild upper respiratory symptoms.

Type A influenza virus

For influenza type A, at least 16 highly variable hemagglutinins( a glycoprotein which causes red blood cells to clump together- H1 to H16) and 9 distinct NAs (N1 to N9) have been recognized so far. With the aid of these different antigens, the influenza type A virus is further subdivided into subtypes on the basis of variable combination patterns of their own specific H or N proteins, for example H1N1 or H3N2.

Type B influenza virus

The influenza B virus has a similar viral structure to type A, but, due to the fixed antigenic characters of HA and NA, there are no subtypes in this virus. Still, since the 1970s, some small antigenic variability has been reported in this virus. Also, studies have shown that this virus has started to diverge into 2 antigenically distinguishable lineages.","Risk Factors For Influenza
Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and reducing the risk of severe outcomes. However, groups of individuals who are at high risk include:


Adults above the age of 65 years


Children below 5 years (especially< 2 years)


Pregnant women (2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy up to 2 weeks postpartum)


Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities


Individuals with certain chronic medical conditions like


Chronic pulmonary diseases


Cardiovascular conditions


Diabetes mellitus


Kidney disorders


Liver diseases


Blood disorders


Metabolic disorders


Cognitive dysfunction 


Neuromuscular disorders


Stroke


Seizure disorders




Immunocompromised patients


Current or past use of tobacco


Obese individuals with BMI > 40


Children and adolescents receiving aspirin or salicylate-containing medications might be at risk for developing Reye syndrome (a rare but serious condition that causes swelling in the liver and brain) with influenza virus infection.

","Diagnosis Of Influenza

Influenza virus testing is not required to make a clinical diagnosis of influenza in outpatients with suspected influenza, particularly when seasonal influenza A and B viruses are circulating in the local community.Influenza testing is recommended for all patients requiring hospitalization with suspected influenza, including those admitted to the ICU during influenza season with acute respiratory illness and community-acquired pneumonia, without a clear alternative diagnosis. Also, all individuals requiring critical care outside of influenza season should be tested for influenza if there is a possible link to an individual with recent influenza, such as travel to areas with influenza activity or exposure to an institutional influenza outbreak.However, during periods of low influenza activity and outside of epidemics situations, the infection of other respiratory viruses e.g.  parainfluenza, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,and adenovirus can also present with similar symptoms which makes the clinical differentiation of influenza from other viruses difficult.Several kinds of influenza diagnostic tests are available in clinical settings with variable sensitivities and specificities. They include:

Rapid influenza diagnostic Test (RIDT)

Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are the most common tests used in clinical settings. RIDTs work by detecting the parts of the virus (antigens) that stimulate an immune response. These tests can provide results within approximately 10-15 minutes but may not be as accurate as other flu tests as their reliability depends largely on the conditions under which they are used. Therefore, one could still have influenza, even though your rapid test result is negative.

Rapid molecular assay 

Rapid molecular assays are a new type of molecular influenza diagnostic test to detect influenza viral RNA or nucleic acids in upper respiratory tract specimens in approximately 15-30 minutes.  They are more accurate than RIDTs.In addition to RIDTs and rapid molecular assays, there are more accurate tests available that have to be performed in specialized laboratories. Results may take one to several hours. Proper collection, storage and transport of respiratory specimens is the essential first step for laboratory detection of influenza virus infections. Sample collection requires the healthcare provider to swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab and then send the swab for testing. The tests are discussed below:
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) can identify the presence of influenza viral RNA in respiratory specimens with very high sensitivity and specificity.Immunofluorescence assay (direct and indirect)
Immunofluorescence assays are antigen detection assays that generally require use of a fluorescent microscope to produce results in approximately 2-4 hours with moderate sensitivity and high specificity. Both direct (DFA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) staining assays are available to detect influenza A and B viral antigens in respiratory tract specimens. Subtyping or further identification of influenza A viruses is not possible by immunofluorescence assays.

Viral culture (shell vials; cell mixtures)

Viral or rapid cell culture results do not yield timely results to inform clinical management. Shell-vial tissue culture results may take 1-3 days, while traditional tissue-cell viral culture results may take 3-10 days. However, viral culture allows for extensive antigenic and genetic characterization of influenza viruses. The collection of some respiratory samples for viral culture is essential for surveillance and antigenic characterization of new seasonal influenza A and B virus strains that may need to be included in next year’s influenza vaccine.
 
Serologic testing
Serological testing for influenza is not recommended for clinical decision-making. Although offered by some commercial laboratories, serological testing results for antibodies to influenza A or B viruses on a single serum specimen cannot be reliably interpreted. Proper serological testing for diagnosis of influenza requires paired acute and convalescent sera collected 2-3 weeks apart, with reliable testing at a limited number of public health or research laboratories to assess a 4-fold or greater rise in influenza virus strain-specific antibodies. Therefore, serological testing for influenza does not provide timely results to help with clinical decisions-making and is not recommended except for research and public health investigations.H1N1 is a subtype of influenza and is commonly known as swine flu. Read about H1N1 qualitative RT-PCR.Click To Read!","Prevention Of Influenza

Influenza is commonly seen during seasonal changes and affects almost all age groups. It can be prevented to a certain extent through the following:

Vaccination
The best way to prevent influenza is to receive an influenza vaccination every year as stated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Anyone above the age 6 months and older should get vaccinated annually. The best time to get the flu vaccine is in the early fall months ie. August to October. It takes about 3 weeks for the vaccine to wield its protective benefits.Flu vaccines can vary in how well they work, but even in cases when flu vaccination does not prevent infection completely, it can reduce the severity and duration of disease and prevent serious complications especially in elderly patients.Vaccination is especially important for people at high risk of influenza complications, and for people who live with or care for the people at high risk. WHO recommends annual vaccination for the following groups of people:


Health-care workers


Pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy


Children between 6 months to 5 years of age


Elderly individuals above 65 years of age


Individuals diagnosed with chronic medical conditions


Although the flu vaccine is safe, it is contraindicated or not advised in case someone is:


Allergic to eggs


Allergic to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine


Suffering from a fever. It is advisable to get the vaccine shot after recovering from illness.


Having history of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a severely paralyzing condition, after getting the flu vaccine


Nasal flu vaccine which is administered through the nose is also available for prevention of flu. However, it is not advised in the following: 


Children and adolescents who are taking aspirin or any type of salicylate-containing medications.


Children who are 2 to 4 years of age who have been diagnosed with asthma or have a history of wheezing.


Immunocompromised patients.


Caregivers or close contacts of severely immunosuppressed patients.


Pregnant women.


Patients who have received antiviral drugs to treat the flu within the past 48 hours.


Note: Pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis with antivirals is possible but depends on several factors e.g. individual factors, type of exposure, and risk associated with the exposure. Learn more about inactivated influenza vaccines.Click Now!
Chemoprophylaxis strategy
Available antiviral drugs play an important role for patients who have not been immunized or who are nonresponsive to vaccines. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are the recommended drugs for the prevention of influenza based on their established efficacy and low rates of resistance in comparison to adamantanes that include the oral medications amantadine and rimantadine that block the M2 ion channel on influenza A viruses. Some indications for chemoprophylaxis include:


Influenza prophylaxis should be given during influenza outbreaks in long-term care centers in the elderly regardless of prior influenza vaccinations




To be given in unvaccinated individuals at high risk of influenza complications who have been exposed to an individual with influenza infections within the previous 48 hours




For vaccinated persons at high risk of influenza complications who have had close contact with an individual with influenza within the previous 48 hours when there is a poor match between the vaccine and circulating viruses in a given year




The United States’ ACIP recommends that antiviral chemoprophylaxis be considered in pregnant women and in women up to 2 weeks postpartum who have close contact with suspected or confirmed influenza A-infected individuals. Zanamivir may be the drug of choice for prophylaxis due to its limited systemic absorption


General measures
Apart from vaccination and antiviral treatment, the public health management includes maintaining personal protection through:


Washing hands regularly with proper drying of the hands


Covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, using tissues and disposing of them correctly


Self-isolating at an early stage of those feeling unwell, feverish and having other symptoms of influenza


Avoiding close contact with sick people


Avoiding touching one’s eyes, nose or mouth.


Kids, pregnant women, diabetics, elderly people and those with a weak immune system are at a high risk of suffering from this viral infection. Hence, it is wise to follow preventive measures to protect from seasonal flu rather than get it treated after acquiring the infection.Read about 7 tips to prevent seasonal flu.Click Here!","Treatment Of Influenza

Influenza also known as flu causes mild illness generally and the treatment depends on the condition of the patient, that includes:

Patients with uncomplicated seasonal influenza

Patients that are not from a high risk group should be managed with symptomatic treatment. If they are symptomatic it is best to stay home in order to minimize the risk of infecting others in the community. Treatment mainly focuses on relieving symptoms of influenza such as fever, cough, cold or sore throat. Patients should monitor themselves to detect if their condition deteriorates and seek medical attention.Patients that are known to be in a group at high risk for developing severe or complicated illness should be treated with antivirals in addition to symptomatic treatment as soon as possible.

Patients with severe or progressive clinical illness 
Patients associated with suspected or confirmed influenza virus infection like clinical syndromes of pneumonia, sepsis or exacerbation of chronic underlying diseases, should be treated with antiviral drugs as soon as possible. These drugs may shorten the illness and help prevent serious complications. The drugs are discussed as follows:Oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu): This is an oral prescription drug used to treat influenza in patients who are two weeks of age and older. It is also approved to prevent flu in patients who are one year of age and older. Important points regarding this drug are:


This drug should be prescribed as soon as possible (ideally, within 48 hours following symptom onset) to maximize therapeutic benefits.


Administration of the drug should also be considered in patients presenting later in the course of illness.


Treatment is recommended for a minimum of 5 days, but can be extended until there is satisfactory clinical improvement.


Potential side effects include nausea, vomiting, nosebleeds, headaches and tiredness.


Zanamivir (Relenza): This drug is approved to treat flu in patients seven years and older, and to prevent flu in patients who are five and older. This product is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler. It is not recommended for people who have certain chronic respiratory illnesses like asthma or COPD. Common side effects of the drug include headache, nausea, diarrhea, nose irritation and vomiting.Peramivir (Rapivab): Peramivir is approved to treat influenza in patients 2 years and older. This drug is injected into the vein (intravenously) by a healthcare provider. A common side effect of this drug is diarrhea.Baloxavir (Xofluza): This drug is approved to treat flu in people 12 years old and older. Common side effects include diarrhea, bronchitis, nausea and headache.Antiviral drugs: Antiviral drugs like amantadine and rimantadine (Flumadine) are older antiviral drugs which are approved to treat influenza, but most circulating strains of influenza have become resistant to them. Hence, they are no longer recommended.Corticosteroids: These should not be used routinely, unless indicated for other reasons (eg: asthma and other specific conditions); as it has been associated with prolonged viral clearance, immunosuppression leading to bacterial or fungal superinfection.Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs which are used to provide symptomatic relief from inflammation, swelling, redness, and itching.

Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It generally causes mild to moderate symptoms, but in certain cases can lead to complications that include:

Pneumonia

The most important and common complication of influenza is pneumonia that may happen as a continuation of the acute influenza syndrome when caused by the influenza virus (primary pneumonia) or as a mixed viral and bacterial infection after a gap of a few days (secondary pneumonia).

Primary influenza viral pneumonia

The illness occurs after the typical course of flu with a rapid progression of fever, shortness of breath, cough, cyanosis (low blood oxygen), and difficulty breathing. It happens predominantly among individuals with cardiovascular or underlying pulmonary diseases such as asthma. The most severe cases progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (when fluid builds up in the tiny, elastic air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs) along with involvement of multiple lobes. These patients usually present with progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath) and severe hypoxemia (when enough oxygen is not available to maintain the self regulating mechanism in the body) 2 to 5 days after the onset of typical influenza symptoms. Hypoxemia increases rapidly and causes respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, maybe after only 1 day of hospitalization.

Secondary bacterial pneumonia

Recently, community–acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was determined as the causative agent for secondary bacterial pneumonia after seasonal influenza,but another very common etiologic bacterium is Streptococcus pneumonia. The patients have a classic influenza disease, followed by an improvement period lasting for maximum 2 weeks.The recurrence of the symptoms such as fever, productive cough, and dyspnea and findings of new consolidations in chest imaging can be found in involved patients. Accordingly, a biphasic pattern of signs and symptoms in influenza-labeled patients should be considered as secondary superimposed bacterial pneumonia.

Non-pulmonary complications

In addition to its respiratory effects, the virus can exert effects on other body systems such as the musculoskeletal, cardiac, and neurologic systems. Some of the extrapulmonary symptoms include:


Myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle)


Pericarditis (inflammation of saclike covering of the heart)


Stroke


Encephalopathy (brain damage due to virus, bacteria, or toxins)


Mild myositis (weak, painful or aching muscles)


Myoglobinuria (excessive protein called myoglobin in urine)


Other rare complications such as


Guillain–Barré syndrome (a rare disorder in which your body's immune system attacks your nerves. Weakness and tingling in your extremities)


Acute liver failure


Reye syndrome



",,"Alternative Therapies For Influenza

Influenza is contagious and can cause mild to severe illness. Alternative therapy along with medications that can help in fighting the flu and relieve the symptoms include:

Natural therapy

There are a dozen things to do while the individual has the flu, but the age-old natural remedies can never go wrong. Here is a list of natural ingredients that can help:1. Garlic (Lahsun)
Garlic provides many health benefits like enhancing the immune function and decreasing the severity of flu. 2. Ginger (Adrak)
Ginger is widely used in herbal medicine and as a well known home remedy to beat nausea. Adding ginger to the tea can soothe the throat as well.3. Herbal tea
An herbal tea may help your body fight off the flu virus. A hot herbal drink is also soothing to the throat and sinuses.4. Honey (Shahad)
There are numerous benefits of honey-like antibacterial properties, stimulating the immune system, relieving seasonal allergy, and helping in suppressing cough in children.5. Turmeric (Haldi)
It helps the body to naturally cleanse the respiratory tract, and helps fight the infection and relieves direct impact of cold and flu due to its anti-inflammatory properties.6. Spices
Certain spices, such as pepper and horseradish, can help break up congestion and help breathe better.7. Yogurt (Dahi)
Yogurt with live cultures not only can help soothe a sore throat but can also boost the immune system."

","Symptoms Of Insomnia
The symptoms of insomnia include:

Difficulty falling asleep
Difficulty staying asleep
Getting up too early
Problems in day to day functioning due to insufficient sleep
Problems with concentration and memory
Tiredness and sleepiness during day time
Problems with work, family, and social life
Irritability, grumpiness, mood swings, and anxiety

Increased errors or accidents
","Causes Of Insomnia

To know the causes, it is important to understand the basics of sleep. Several structures within the brain are involved with sleep mechanisms. Two internal biological mechanisms – circadian rhythm and homeostasis – work together to regulate when you are awake and asleep. One of the key hormones responsible for maintenance of the sleep wake cycle is melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland in our body.

Circadian rhythms 

Circadian rhythm influences many functions from daily fluctuations in wakefulness to body temperature, metabolism, and release of hormones. It controls the cause of being sleepy at night and the tendency to wake in the morning without an alarm. The body’s biological clock, which is based on a roughly 24-hour day, controls most circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms synchronize with environmental cues (light and temperature) about the actual time of day, but they continue even in the absence of cues as they are not driven by the environment.

Sleep-wake homeostasis

It keeps track of your need for sleep. The homeostatic sleep drive reminds the body to sleep after a certain time and regulates sleep intensity. This sleep drive gets stronger every hour you are awake and causes you to sleep longer and more deeply after a period of sleep deprivation.
Factors that influence your sleep-wake needs include medical conditions, medications, stress, sleep environment, and what you eat and drink.","Types Of Insomnia
The type of insomnia one experiences has a lot to do with the underlying causes of insomnia.
Acute or short-term insomnia
It is having problems with sleep only for a brief period of time. This could be due to:

Stress caused by a painful event in life such as loss of job, death of a loved one, and divorce 
Worry before an exam
Anxiety before an interview
Pain or uneasiness due to an illness
Travel that causes jet lag
Unfamiliar surroundings like sleeping in a hotel or a new home
Uncomfortable bed
Disturbances due to noise and light
Occupational night shifts

Chronic or long-term insomnia
It happens when you have trouble falling asleep for at least 3 days in a week for 3 consecutive months. It may occur due to:


Stress


Parkinson's disease


Alzheimer's disease


Depression


Mania or bipolar disorder


Post traumatic disorder


Drug abuse


Alcohol intake


Heavy smoking


Obstructive sleep apnea


Poor sleep habits


Medical conditions like asthma & heart failure

","Risk Factors For Insomnia
Almost everyone might have experienced difficulty in sleeping at one point in their life. However, your risk of suffering insomnia is high, if you:


Are a woman due to hormonal changes during periods and pregnancy


Are above 60 years of age as with age changes in sleep patterns occur


Have a chronic health condition which can impact your physical as well as mental health


Are taking certain medications such as steroids, decongestants, and antihypertensives which risk of sleeping problems as a side-effect


Are stressed due to family matters, job pressure or any other triggers of stress


Have an irregular lifestyle pattern such as night shifts, poor sleep environment, exercising or use of devices close to bedtime


Excessive use of stimulants like coffee or tea especially during the evening or close to bed can can interfere with your sleep schedule


Alcohol consumption may help you fall asleep, but when consumed in excess, it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often causes awakening in the middle of the night and hence deteriorates the sleep quality

",,"Specialist To Visit 
If you face any difficulty in falling asleep at night or if you have been suffering from any chronic health problem that is affecting your sleep patterns, then it is wise to consult a doctor at the earliest.Although, your general physician is the first doctor you may need to consult to know the cause of insomnia, other specialists who can help in the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia and its related health complications are:

Treatment of insomnia includes making changes in sleep habits, taking medicines, doing relaxation exercises, and treating the underlying condition that causes insomnia. 

1. Cognitive behavioral therapy 

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) can help you control or eliminate negative thoughts and actions that keep you awake and is generally recommended as the first line of treatment for people with insomnia. Typically, CBT-I is equally or more effective than sleep medications.The cognitive part of CBT-I teaches you to recognize and change beliefs that affect your ability to sleep while the behavioral part of CBT-I helps you develop good sleep habits and avoid behaviors that keep you from sleeping well.

2. Medications

1. BenzodiazepinesIt inhibits the reticular activating system (RAS) center, also known as awakening center, thereby inducing sleep. Benzodiazepines carry a risk of addiction and abuse, especially in patients with history of alcohol or sedative abuse, so medical supervision is advisable. Some of the common examples of this class of drugs include:


Alprazolam


Lorazepam


Clonazepam 


2. BarbituratesThese drugs act on the GABA receptor thereby aiding in sleep. It causes long term changes thereby ensuring that the effect of the drug lasts for a long time. Examples include: 


Thiopentone sodium


Methohexitone


Phenobarbitone


3. (Z) Drugs These drugs are basically newer drugs of benzodiazepine agonist class, however they are relatively more specific as these act on alpha 1 subunit of GABA-A receptor. These are recommended for early phase insomnia, late phase insomnia and middle of night awakening problems. The medications that belong to this group include:


Zolpidem


Zopiclone


Zaleplon


4. Heterocyclic antidepressantsThese are the most commonly prescribed alternatives to benzodiazepine receptor agonists due to their lack of abuse potential and lower cost. The common examples include:

Trazodone
Amitriptyline

5. Melatonin receptor agonistsAs the name suggests, these drugs act on the melatonin receptor to include sleep. These drugs are mostly recommended for people with sleep cycle disorder (people who sleep at any time other than the actual sleeping time), shift workers, and insomnia due to jet lag. Some of the common drugs include:


Ramelton 


Agomelatine


6. Orexin pathway inhibitorsThese drugs inhibit the chemical orexin, which is known to keep the RAS center active.  Suvorexant is a commonly used drug that belongs to this class.7. AntihistaminesAntihistamines such as diphenhydramine are the primary active ingredients in the most over-the-counter sleep aids. Some of the side effects include dry mouth and constipation.

Do’s and Don’ts when using sleeping pills



Never mix sleeping pills with alcohol or other sedative drugs.


Always consult your doctor prior to taking any sleeping pill as most of these medicines have abuse potential.


Don’t take a second dose in the middle of the night.


Start with the lowest recommended dose. 


Avoid frequent use of sleeping pills to avoid dependency and lower its side-effects.


Never drive a car or operate machinery after taking a sleeping pill.


Carefully read the package insert for any potential side effects and drug interactions.


Note: Medications for insomnia may increase the risk of injurious falls and confusion in elderly. Hence, they should be taken cautiously in the lowest effective dose and under strict medical supervision."," Home-care For Insomnia 
Your need for sleep and your sleep patterns change as you age but this varies significantly across individuals of the same age. There is no magic “number of sleep hours” that works for everybody of the same age. 


Babies initially sleep as much as 16 to 18 hours per day, which may boost growth and development (especially of the brain). 


School-aged children and teens on an average need about 9.5 hours of sleep per night. 


Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep a night but after age 60, nighttime sleep tends to be shorter, lighter, and interrupted by multiple awakenings.

Sleep problems are associated with short and long-term effects on health and well-being. The immediate effects include poor performance, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. The long term complications caused due to sleep deprivation include premature mortality, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression.Some of the common effects of sleep deprivation include:

1. Accidents

Fatal road accidents are caused due to sleepiness or driver fatigue.

2. Heart disease

Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea have also been linked to higher rates of hypertension. Moreover, sleep loss can affect inflammatory markers, which in turn can increase the risk of heart disease. Studies have shown that inflammatory responses are increased in people with obstructive sleep apnoea.

3. Obesity

The role of obesity and sleep loss is bidirectional. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is over double among the obese. It is reported that 3–5% of the overall proportion of obesity in adults could be attributable to short sleep.

4. Diabetes

Sleep restriction and poor quality of sleep are linked to increased risk of diabetes. Lack of sleep is linked to glucose dysregulation and an increase in hunger and appetite via hormonal imbalance. It causes down-regulation of the satiety hormone, leptin, and up-regulation of the appetite-stimulating hormone, ghrelin.

5. Stress & anxiety

Lack of sleep can lead to mental disorders such as stress and anxiety. However, depression is also one of the most prevalent of the conditions associated with troubled sleep. Poor sleep can up the levels of stress hormones and in the long run, can affect mental health. Insomnia can negatively affect work performance, impair decision-making, damage relationships and decline overall quality of life.

6. Poor performance

A direct way that sleep and school or job performance are connected is through effects on mental functioning. Some known problems associated with lack of sleep include decreased attention. The ability to concentrate is vital to learning and academic achievement but insufficient sleep reduces attention and focus.Here are a few tips that will help you get a goodnight’s sleep and avoid complications of insomnia.Check Here!","Alternative Therapies For Insomnia
If you are one of those who has problems falling asleep, read on to know about some of the best foods to have before you hit the bed.
1. Cherries
Cherries contain melatonin, which is a sleep-regulating hormone. A study shows that drinking 200 ml tart cherry juice twice a day helps in increasing sleep quality and duration. This is an excellent remedy for people suffering from insomnia. Drink a glass of cherry juice before going to bed. You can add some water, if you do not like its taste.2. Kiwis
Kiwis have high levels of antioxidants and serotonin, a hormone that aids in sleep. As low levels of serotonin can lead to insomnia, munching two kiwis an hour before sleep can help you to sleep better. 3. Walnuts (Akhrot)
Like cherries, walnuts are also a source of melatonin. Eating a handful of walnuts will help you sail through the night. Since nuts are high in calories, just having 20-30 gms of it would be sufficient.4. Banana (Kela)
They are a rich source of potassium and magnesium which acts as muscle relaxing agents. In addition, they contain amino acid tryptophan which the body converts to serotonin. Plus, they are a source of carbohydrates which will make you feel sleepy as well.5. Leafy green vegetables
Leafy green vegetables such as turnip green and spinach have calcium which is used by the brain to produce sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. Try a leafy vegetable salad for dinner.6. Almond butter
Almond butter is a source of magnesium, low levels of which are related to insomnia. Munch a whole grain toast coated with almond butter as a pre-sleep snack.7. Sleep-inducing teas 
Teas like chamomile (babunah ke phul) tea, passion flower tea, magnolia bark tea,  peppermint (pudina) tea, and lavender tea can promote good sleep.However, remember not to eat too much just before trying to sleep. Scheduling your dinner time in the evenings may help you sleep better. Doing regular light exercise can help you get a good sleep. Try yoga, meditation or breathing exercises to relax.

Supplements for insomnia

There are many dietary and herbal supplements available in the market that are known for their sleep-promoting effects. As these supplements can interfere with other medications and vitamin supplements, it is best to talk to your doctor before taking them. The two common supplements for insomnia are:
Melatonin: It is a hormone that helps to regulate the sleep-wake cycle and is known to be effective for people who are night owls (who go to bed and wake up late). It is available as an over-the-counter (OTC) supplement. Valerian: It is a herbal supplement which is known to have mild sedative (sleep-inducing) effects. There are a wide range of valerian supplements available. Pick the one that best suits your needs."

","Symptoms Of Japanese Encephalitis
Generally, patients suffering from JE do not present with any symptoms, but if there are symptoms, they will appear 5 to 15 days after being infected. In mild cases of Japanese encephalitis, individuals might only develop fever and a headache, but in more severe cases, serious symptoms can develop quickly.Some of the possible symptoms include:


Headache


High fever


Nausea


Vomiting


Stiff neck


Tremors (shaking)


Hyperactivity of the muscles


Abnormal posturing


Abdominal pain


The symptoms of Japanese encephalitis that indicate brain inflammation include deafness, uncontrollable emotions, and weakness on one side of the body, which can cause lifelong complications. In some cases, individuals might also undergo changes to brain function such as: 


Disorientation


Coma


Stupor (state of near-unconsciousness)


Convulsions or seizures in children


Swelling of the testicles (in rare cases)

","Causes Of Japanese Encephalitis

Japanese encephalitis is caused by a flavivirus, which can affect both humans and animals. The virus is passed from animals to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Understanding the transmission cycle is very important in knowing the cause.
Transmission
This virus exists in the zoonotic transmission cycle, which means the infections spread from animals, through insects to humans. The general carrier and host of this virus are:


Mosquitoes: The major mosquito vectors of JEV vary in different geographic regions, but the most common are Culex species (mainly Culex tritaeniorhynchus).


Pigs: They are the main contributors in the transmission cycle with respect to human infection, because these animals often stay close to human dwellings.


Bats: Recently, JEV antibodies were detected in bats, revealing that bats can be a part of the JEV transmission cycle.


Water birds: The birds belonging to the family Ardeidae (cattle egrets and pond herons) are important maintenance hosts.


In most temperate areas of Asia, JEV is transmitted mainly during the warm season whereas in the tropics and subtropical regions, transmission can occur year-round but often intensifies during the rainy season and pre-harvest period in rice-cultivating regions.First, the endemic region is composed of Southern India, Southern Vietnam, Southern Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Secondly, the intermediary subtropical region, which includes Northern India, Nepal, North and Central Burma, Northern Thailand, Northern Vietnam, Southern China, and Bangladesh. Thirdly, the temperate epidemic region, spanning Northern China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the southern extremities of Russia.Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses. Read more about symptoms, causes, treatment and prevention of dengue. Click Now!","Risk Factors For Japanese Encephalitis

The risk of becoming infected with Japanese encephalitis is highest during and right after rainy seasons as mosquitos breed during this time and populations tend to increase suddenly around rainy seasons. The factors determining who of all the infected develop the disease are unknown, but factors such as age, genetic make-up, general health, and pre-existing immunity play an important role in the spread of the disease.People in countries with year-round tropical climates are also at risk of getting Japanese encephalitis. High-risk countries include:


China


Myanmar (Burma)


Thailand


Philippines


Sri Lanka


Malaysia


Indonesia


Vietnam


Cambodia


Laos


Nepal


India


Overall, for every million travelers it is estimated that there's less than 1 case of Japanese encephalitis. But there are certain activities that can increase the risk of getting the infection. These include:


Visiting rural areas during the rainy season


Camping, or traveling in high-risk areas for a long time


Living or working outdoors in rural areas

","Diagnosis Of Japanese Encephalitis

Individuals who live in or have traveled to a JE-endemic area and experience encephalitis are considered a suspected JE case. Confirming the diagnosis consist of the following:
Detailed medical and travel history
Japanese encephalitis (JE) should be considered in a patient with evidence of a neurologic infection like meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis (onset of weakness or paralysis with reduced muscle). Individuals who have recently traveled to or resided in an endemic country in Asia or the western Pacific are also suspected of infection with JEV. 
Laboratory tests
Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish JE from other cases of encephalitis, therefore laboratory confirmation is necessary in such circumstances. This is generally accomplished by testing of the following:1. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): The ideal method for laboratory confirmation is testing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum for JEV-specific IgM antibodies to detect virus-specific IgM antibodies. JE virus IgM antibodies are usually detectable 3 to 8 days after onset of illness and persist for 30 to 90 days, but longer persistence has also been documented.2. Peripheral blood picture: A peripheral smear examination shows moderate leukocytosis with relative lymphopenia (decreased white blood cells called lymphocytes). The case fatality rate is high, around 25–50%, and most of the deaths occur around 5–9 days after onset.3. Serological tests: In JE cases, generally the infection is asymptomatic. Several assays have been developed for detection of antibodies induced by natural infection or vaccination. A multitude of tests based on nucleic acid detection have been explored for JEV detection in humans as well as the swine population. These tests include:


Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT): PRNT is considered as a gold standard in flavivirus diagnosis. To discriminate between potentially cross-reactive antibodies with other flaviviruses, PRNT is the test of choice. A fourfold increase in IgG titre in acute and convalescent sera is considered as a confirmatory test. 


Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test: The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is used to titrate the antibody response to a viral infection. The principle behind the hemagglutination test is that the nucleic acids of viruses encode proteins such as hemagglutinin, that are expressed on the surface of the virus.


Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA): It is a standard virologic technique to identify the presence of antibodies by their specific ability to react with viral antigens expressed in infected cells; bound antibodies are visualized by incubation with fluorescently labeled anti-human antibody.


Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): The JEV-specific IgM antibody capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) has now become the first-line diagnostic assay recommended by the WHO for detection of acute infections.


Virus isolation: Isolation can be done in mice using intra cerebral route. However, transient and low-level presence of virus in blood is observed in JE infection, therefore, the isolation of virus is not a method of choice for diagnosis in clinical specimens.


Nucleic acid amplification: The RT-PCR tests, quantitative PCR (TaqMan), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis are useful molecular assay tests as they are very specific, sensitive and can detect low viral copies in acute or early phase of infection.


Staphylococcal coagglutination tests: This test is done using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies in rapid diagnosis of JE. 

","Prevention Of Japanese Encephalitis
Japanese encephalitis virus is spread to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. The best way to prevent Japanese encephalitis virus infection is to protect from mosquito bites. The tips that can help prevent it are:


Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered insect repellents


Spray insect repellent onto hands and then apply to a child’s face


Cover strollers and baby carriers with mosquito netting


Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para-menthane-diol (PMD) for children under 3 years old


Do not apply insect repellent to a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, cuts, or irritated skin


Always follow the product label instructions


Reapply insect repellent as directed


Do not spray repellent on the skin under clothing


Apply sunscreen first and then insect repellent, if using a sunscreen


Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants


Use 0.5% permethrin (insecticide that kills or repels mosquitoes) to treat clothing and gear (such as boots, pants, socks, and tents) 


Use screens on windows and doors and repair holes in screens to keep mosquitoes outdoors


Prevent water stagnation to stop mosquitoes from laying eggs in or near water


Use air conditioning, if available 


Empty or throw out items that hold water such as tires, buckets, planters, toys, pools, birdbaths, flowerpots, or trash containers, once a week


While traveling, choose a hotel or lodging with air conditioning or window and door screens


Minimize outdoor activities during dawn and dusk in JE endemic areas


Improved and safe methods of animal rearing


Use mosquito nets correctly in the following way:


Tuck the net under the mattress to keep the mosquitoes out


Tuck netting under the crib mattress or select a mosquito net long enough to touch the floor


Pull the net tightly to avoid choking hazards for young children. Check label instructions for additional information


Hook or tie the sides of the net to other objects if they are sagging in towards the sleeping area


Check for holes or tears in the net where mosquitoes can enter


Do not sleep directly against the net, as mosquitoes can still bite through holes in the net




Travelers to rural areas can be vaccinated after consulting the doctor. Types of vaccinations available are:


Purified, formalin-inactivated mouse-brain-derived JE vaccine


Inactivated hamster kidney cell-culture-derived JE vaccine


Vaccine based on the SA14-14-2 strain 


Cell-culture derived live attenuated JE vaccine




Vaccination in India
The JE vaccination campaign was launched during 2006 wherein 11 of the most sensitive districts in Assam, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh were covered. Altogether, 86 JE endemic districts in the states of Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal have been covered. Inactivated Japanese Encephalitis virus protein is used for prevention of Japanese Encephalitis.

 ","Treatment Of Japanese Encephalitis
There is no specific treatment for JE except for supportive care for hospitalized patients, controlling convulsions and treating raised intracranial pressure when they occur.Treatment is mostly symptomatic and consist of the following:


Adequate amount of fluids


Use of pain relievers


Medication to reduce fever may relieve some symptoms


Apart from this there are few other promising modalities like:
Interferons
Interferon-á is currently the most promising potential treatment. It is produced naturally in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in response to infection with Japanese encephalitis virus.Naturally occurring compounds such as arctigenin, a phenylpropanoid dibenzyl butyrolactone lignan, and rosmarinic acid, a phenolic compound found in various herbs like basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, and oregano has been found to provide protection to mice against JEV.

Antiviral drugs

A number of antiviral agents have been investigated, including INF alfa-2a68 and diethyldithiocarbamate (a low molecular weight dithiol). However, none of these have convincingly been shown to improve the outcome of JE. Mannitol might be used to reduce intracranial pressure.Minocycline, a member of the broad-spectrum antibiotic tetracycline group, has been a notable breakthrough in anti-flavivirus drug research. Another compound that has shown inhibition of JEV replication completely in vitro is an N-methylisatin-β-thiosemicarbazone derivative.
Glucosidase inhibitors
This works on the mechanism that eliminates the production of several endoplasmic reticulum–budding viruses, including dengue type II (DEN-2) and JEV.Jenvac Vaccine is a medicine used for prevention of Japanese encephalitis (JE). It protects against JE and is given as part of a universal immunization program for selected places endemic to JE. Read more about it.Click Now!","Home-care For Japanese Encephalitis

There is no effective and exact treatment for Japanese Encephalitis, but like any other viral infections, mild symptoms can be managed by:


Drinking adequate fluids


Taking enough rest


Eating a nutritious, wholesome and well balanced diet


Managing pain with painkillers


Taking multivitamin supplements


Adding honey and lemon to the diet


Keeping oneself warm and comfortable


Adding bananas and rice to soothe an upset stomach and curb diarrhea


Relieving the symptoms of fever with tulsi leaves

",,"Complications Of Japanese Encephalitis
Complications of JE that increase risk of death are treatable in most of the cases. Some of the common complications include:


Seizures: JE is associated with seizures in 46% of the patients in the acute stage of encephalitis which is easily controlled by monotherapy. 


Increased intracranial pressure: Growing pressure inside of the skull due to seizures in case of JE.


Status epilepticus: A seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes, or having more than 1 seizure within a 5 minutes period, without returning to a normal level of consciousness between episodes.


Parkinson's-like symptoms: These include symptoms such as mask‐like face, rigidity, and tremor. However, acute flaccid paralysis can be a presenting symptom.


Acute encephalitis: Rapid implantation of the brain, most commonly caused by virus.


Aspiration pneumonia: It occurs when food, saliva, liquids, or vomit is breathed into the lungs or airways leading to the lungs, instead of being swallowed into the esophagus and stomach. This is due to reduced gag reflex in patients with JE.


The case-fatality rate among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30% and permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae can occur in 30%–50% of those with encephalitis. Read about ways to prevent it.Click Now!","Alternative Therapies For Japanese Encephalitis

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can be a product of T cells and can act on T cells. Pentoxifylline has been studied as an adjunctive treatment for both malaria and dengue fever because of its anti-TNF activity, can also inhibit JEV replication in vitro and has protective effects in mouse models of Japanese encephalitis.
TLRs
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. Tlr4 protects mice against the lethal effects of Japanese encephalitis; therefore, this receptor represents a potential therapeutic target. The effect of TLR4 is nullified by eritoran (an investigational drug for the treatment of severe sepsis), which has been used in phase III trials for sepsis and has also been shown to protect mice in a model of influenza."

","Symptoms Of Jaundice
Some individuals may present certain signs and symptoms while others don’t. Here are common symptoms of jaundice that include:


A yellow tinge to the skin, mucous membranes, and the whites of the eyes


Pale or clay-colored stools


Dark urine


Itchiness in the skin


Weight loss


Vomiting


Nausea


Loss of appetite


Other symptoms that accompany jaundice may include:


Fatigue, tiredness, and drowsiness


Abdominal pain and tenderness


Blood in vomit or stool


Dark or tarry stool


Flu-like symptoms (fever and chills)


Agitation or confusion


Easy bruising or bleeding, causing the tiny reddish-purple rash

",,"Causes Of Jaundice
On the basis of causes, jaundice can be classified into three types. They are:


Pre-hepatic jaundice


Hepatic jaundice


Post-hepatic jaundice



1. Pre-hepatic jaundice

This type of jaundice is caused due to hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), therefore it is also known as hemolytic jaundice. The causes of prehepatic/hemolytic jaundice are classified into: Congenital causes (present at birth)


Spherocytosis: This condition affects the red blood cells (RBCs) and is characterized by anemia, jaundice, and enlarged spleen.


Elliptocytosis: It is a hereditary disorder in which the RBCs are elliptical in shape rather than the normal round shape.


Congenital LCAT deficiency: This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to process cholesterol. It is characterized by corneal opacities (clear front surface of the eye), hemolytic anemia, and kidney failure.


Thalassemia: It is an inherited blood disorder caused when the body doesn't make enough hemoglobin.


Sickle cell anemia: It is a group of inherited disorders known as sickle cell disease that affects the shape of RBCs. 


Stomatocytosis: A rare condition of RBCs characterized by a mouthlike or slitlike pattern rather than the normal shape.


Acanthocytosis: It is a red cell phenotype (determines the antigen present in RBCs) indicative of various underlying conditions.


Echinocytes: In this condition, the RBCs are crenated (notched) and resemble a hedgehog or sea urchin rather than the pale-centered biconcave disks.


GSH synthetase deficiency: Glutathione synthetase (GHS) deficiency is a disorder that prevents the production of an important molecule called glutathione which is required to prevent cell damage.


Pyruvate kinase deficiency: An inherited lack of the enzyme pyruvate kinase, without which, the RBCs break down too easily, resulting in hemolytic anemia (low level of RBCs).


G6PD deficiency: It is a genetic disorder in which the enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is less. G6PD protects RBCs from substances in the blood that could harm them.


Erythroblastosis fetalis: It is hemolytic anemia in the fetus or neonate.


Acquired causes 


Microangiopathy: It is a disease of the microvessels and small blood vessels in the microcirculation system.


Hemolytic uremic syndrome: It is a condition that can occur when the small blood vessels in the kidneys become damaged and inflamed.


Disseminated intravascular clot: This is a serious disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become overactive.


Paroxysmal nightly hemoglobinuria: It is a rare disorder in which RBCs break apart prematurely.


Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: This condition is characterized by the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in small blood vessels throughout the body.


Hypophosphatemia: A condition in which your blood has a low level of phosphorus leading to muscle weakness, respiratory or heart failure, seizures, or comas.


Other causes 


Resorption of extensive hematomas (blood clots)


Autoimmune hemolysis


Long-distance runners


Infections like malaria


Chemicals like nitrites and aniline dyes


Toxins such as snake venoms


Transfusion reactions


Trauma


Vitamin B12 deficiency


Folic acid deficiency

2. Hepatic jaundice
It is a type of jaundice in which the basic defect lies within the liver mainly in the hepatocytes. The causes include:Congenital causes


Wilson’s disease: It is a rare inherited disorder that causes copper to accumulate in your liver, brain, and other vital organs.


Rotor’s syndrome: A mild condition characterized by elevated levels of a substance called bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia).


Hemochromatosis: An inherited condition where iron levels in the body slowly build up over many years.


Crigler Najjar syndrome: It is a severe condition characterized by hyperbilirubinemia.


Gilbert’s syndrome: A common, harmless liver condition in which the liver doesn't properly process bilirubin.


Dubin-Johnson’s syndrome: It is characterized by jaundice that appears during adolescence or early adulthood.


Acquired causes


Drug-related hepatitis (e.g. NSAIDs)


Sepsis


Pregnancy 


Malnutrition


Physical trauma


Hepatic adenoma (non-cancerous liver tumor)


Viral hepatitis


Alcoholic hepatitis


Autoimmune hepatitis


3. Post-hepatic jaundice
It is the type of jaundice in which the cause lies in the biliary portion of the hepatobiliary system (liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts). The major cause of post-hepatic jaundice is biliary obstruction outside the liver, hence, it is also known as obstructive jaundice. The causes include:Congenital causes


Biliary atresia: This is a condition in which there is a blockage in the tubes (ducts) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder.


Cystic fibrosis: An inherited disorder that affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat, and digestive juices.


Idiopathic dilatation of the common bile duct: This can be an indicator for obstructive jaundice.


Pancreatic biliary malfunction: A medical condition that results from the inability of the sphincter to contract and relax normally.


Choledochal cyst: This is a congenital anomaly of the duct (tube) that transports bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine. 


Acquired causes


Portal biliopathy: It refers to the abnormalities seen in bile duct imaging that occur in patients with portal cavernoma (changes in the portal vein).


Strictures: It causes abnormal narrowing of the bodily passages.


Choledocholithiasis: It refers to the presence of at least one gallstone in the common bile duct. 


Intra-abdominal tuberculosis (TB): A type of TB that affects the gut, the peritoneum (the lining of the abdominal cavity), abdominal lymph nodes, and, more rarely, the solid organs in the abdomen like the liver, pancreas, and spleen.


Other causes: Trauma, AIDS, tumors, cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).


Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Read more about pancreatitis.Click Here!",,"Prevention Of Jaundice
Jaundice is related to liver function. Since there are numerous causes for jaundice, there are no perfect prevention guidelines. The basic way to prevent jaundice is by taking care of the liver with several lifestyle changes such as:


Avoiding hepatitis infections


Keeping the weight in check to prevent being overweight or obese


Monitoring cholesterol levels


Eating a well-balanced diet


Exercising regularly


Controlling the alcohol consumption


Making sure that toxins from chemicals and other sources, both inhaled and touched are avoided


Managing medications carefully by avoiding taking more than the recommended dose


Consulting a doctor before starting on any herbal therapies


Quitting smoking and avoiding recreational drugs


Getting the recommended vaccinations before traveling


Practicing safe sex and using condoms to avoid chances of infections


Getting a full body checkup, if family history of autoimmune conditions is present

Jaundice usually does not require any treatment in adults, but the treatment is majorly based on the cause of jaundice. The treatment of choice for jaundice is the correction of the underlying hepatobiliary or hematological disease. Here are some of the options for the treatment and management of jaundice: 


If the cause of jaundice is acute viral hepatitis, then it will go away on its own as the liver begins to heal.


Surgery may be required if the cause of jaundice is a blocked bile duct.


Pruritus (itchy skin) associated with cholestasis (liver disease when the flow of bile from the liver is reduced or blocked) can be managed based on the severity.


For mild pruritus, warm baths or oatmeal baths help in relieving the discomfort. 


Antihistamines can also help with pruritus.


Patients with moderate to severe pruritus can benefit from medications like cholestyramine or colestipol.


Other less effective therapies include:


Rifampin


Naltrexone 


Sertraline 


Phenobarbital 




Hemolytic jaundice is treated with iron medication. Including iron-rich foods in the diet is also effective.


Steroids also prove effective in treating jaundice.


Liver transplantation may be the only effective therapy for pruritus if all the medical treatments fail. A liver transplant is also suggested if jaundice is due to liver decomposition, depending on the severity of the liver injury.

Depending on the cause and severity of the joint pain, your doctor may advise you to take medications to relieve the pain or go for surgery. 
Medical management
It involves use of medications to relieve the symptoms and treat the underlying cause of the joint pain such as arthritis or gout. In some cases, medications to improve overall bone and joint health can be prescribed.
Symptom Relief


NSAID Analgesics help relieve pain and inflammation. These medicines must always be consumed with meals, as taking them on an empty stomach can irritate the gastric lining. Some of the common drugs are Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, Paracetamol.


Narcotics (opioids)  i.e. tramadol, morphine, may be required for severe pain, which is not relieved by the first line of medications. These tablets must be used only as prescribed by the physician as they are potentially habit-forming.




Muscle Relaxants help relieve the painful spasms and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis of the spine. Examples include Cyclobenzaprine.


Corticosteroids may be prescribed for a short duration or even as an injection to address resistant pain. These include drugs containing prednisolone.


Topical application of analgesic ointments (diclofenac), sprays and rubefacient can help with symptomatic pain relief.


Dietary supplements, like glucosamine, calcium, vitamin D3 may help in improvement. 


Intra-articular Injections can be given In cases of severe pain that does not respond to medications, a hydrocortisone injection may be given in the joint to offer quick relief. In some cases, hyaluronic acid injections are also given in the joint to aid joint lubrication.


 
Treatment of underlying cause


Rheumatoid arthritis: Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as Methotrexate and Leflunomide are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.


Gout: Allopurinol formulations and colchicine formulations are used to treat Gout.


Arthritis: Antibiotics are also used to treat septic arthritis.


 
Surgical management and other invasive procedures

In this, use of injections to relieve the pain or corrective surgeries to improve the condition can be advised. Joint replacement surgery is another common procedure used to treat joint pain.
Corrective surgery
Corrective surgeries like synovectomy, osteotomy, laminectomy, spinal fusion, fracture reduction, etc., are performed in the case of severe joint deformities that cause limitation of function and pain.
Joint replacement surgery
For severely damaged knees and hips, a prosthesis may be fitted, and the worn-out joints are completely replaced by mechanical joints. This can be done for hip, knee and shoulder joints. surgeon removes parts of the patient’s bone and implants an artificial joint made from metal or plastic. This procedure has had excellent results and the majority of patients feel long-lasting pain relief after this type of surgery.","Home Care For Joint Pain

Along with medications, the following home care tips can help manage symptoms and lead to the best possible disease outcomes-


Take a wholesome, balanced diet rich in calcium and other minerals.


Follow the exercise routine suggested by the doctor or physiotherapist.


Hot fomentation or icing (as applicable) and application of topical analgesic preparations help relieve pain and stiffness.


Gentle massage performed by a massage therapist can aid relaxation and promote pain relief.


Use joint supports, such as knee caps, cervical collar, lumbosacral belt, wrist cuffs, etc., to help support the frail joints.


The use of walking aids, such as a cane or walker, may help offload the diseased joints, promote safer walking, and offer pain relief.


Avoid lifting heavyweights. When weight training is a part of an exercise program, it must be done with extreme caution and correct ergonomic posture.


Change the mattress and sleeping pillow if not proper and use those that offer good support and stabilize the spine.

Eye redness


Watery discharge


Excessive tearing


Difficulty in opening the eyelid because of pain or irritation


Blurred vision


Reduced vision


Sensitivity to light or photophobia


Feeling of a foreign body like sand in eye

",,"Causes of Keratitis  
Keratitis is classified as either infectious or noninfectious. The various causes of these types are discussed below:

Infectious keratitis 
Infectious keratitis is a major cause of visual impairment and blindness globally, often affecting marginalized populations. The causative agents that cause infectious keratitis are as follows:
1. Bacteria: Bacterial keratitis is usually seen with improper use of contact lenses. It is mostly caused by bacterias like: 

Pseudomonas
Staphylococcus
Streptococcus
Moraxella
Nocardia
Atypical mycobacteria

2. Virus: Viral keratitis is usually associated with the following viruses:


Adenovirus which is one of the causes of upper respiratory tract infections


Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the same virus that causes cold sores 


Herpes zoster virus (HZV) which is associated with chickenpox and shingles 


Zika virus which is transmitted by Aedes aegyptus mosquitoes, the same type that causes dengue


SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is also associated with keratitis


3. Parasite: Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare but serious infection of the eye that can cause permanent vision loss or blindness. This infection is caused by a single-celled living organism called Acanthamoeba. History of exposure to soil or contaminated water is often associated with Acanthamoeba keratitis in the developing countries. However, in the developed world, contact lenses have been found to mostly cause this condition.4. Fungus: Fungal keratitis is a potentially blinding infection of the cornea, which is the clear dome covering the colored part of the eye. This infection mainly occurs due to eye trauma, and use of contact lenses. However, it is also possible to be exposed to these fungi outdoors or during agricultural work. It is caused by the fungi: 

Aspergillus
Fusarium
Candida (yeast)
Cladosporium
Alternaria
Curvularia
Microsporidia. 

5. Oomycete: Oomycete, which is morphologically very similar to fungi, causes pythium keratitis.6. Helminth: Onchocercal keratitis or river blindness (sclerosing keratitis) is a parasitic corneal infection caused by motile worms. Worms do not usually cause blindness by itself, however, as they die naturally or after treatment, they cause inflammation and corneal opacification. Repeated episodes result in complete opacification of the cornea and result in blindness. It is rarely seen in developed countries but very common in the third world countries like the developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Australia. 
Noninfectious keratitis 
The following causes or conditions may lead to noninfectious keratitis:
1. Local causes: The following can cause irritation in the sulcus subtarsalis (a groove in the inner surface of the eyelid near the eyelid margin) and lead to keratitis:


Foreign body


Trichiasis which is anatomic misalignment of eyelashes


Entropion which is a condition in which the eyelid folds inwards


Distichiasis is a rare condition of having two rows of eyelashes


Giant papillae in which the inside of the eyelid which is usually very smooth gets red, swollen, and irritated. It is usually seen in people who wear soft contact lenses.


2. Collagen vascular diseases: Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, relapsing polychondritis, systemic lupus erythematosus can cause peripheral ulcerative keratitis.3. Damage to the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve: Surgeries involving the cornea like cataract surgery, orbital surgery, laser eye surgery to correct vision, corneal transplants and surgery or tumor involving the trigeminal nerve can potentially damage the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve and result in Neurotrophic keratitis.4.  Xerophthalmia: Vitamin A deficiency causes abnormal dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye with subsequent necrosis resulting in keratitis.","Diagnosis of  Keratitis 

In case of any suspected symptoms of keratitis, a doctor should be consulted immediately so that proper treatment is given before any further complications arise.The doctor will examine the eyes and discuss the symptoms that are being experienced.Diagnosing keratitis typically involves the following:
1. Eye exam
If your eye is sealed shut from an infection, the doctor will help you open it to conduct a full examination of eyes and check for visual acuity.
2. Slit-lamp exam
The slit lamp exam is a standard diagnostic procedure, which is also known as biomicroscopy. It is usually a part of a comprehensive eye exam. It provides a bright source of light and magnification to detect the character and extent of keratitis as well as the effect it may have on other structures of the eye.
3. Penlight exam
A penlight is used for checking the pupil for any unusual changes. The doctor may apply a stain to the surface of the eye to identify the extent of surface irregularities, and ulcers of the cornea.
4. Laboratory tests
Doctors can take a sample of tears or a small scraping from the cornea for laboratory analysis to determine the cause of keratitis. This test is also helpful in treatment planning for keratitis. ","Specialist To Visit

The diagnosis of keratitis is done by an ophthalmologist who is a physician who specializes in diseases and surgery of the eye. The ophthalmologist will record comprehensive history and perform physical examination of eyes. If needed, some lab tests or cultures can also be advised.  
If you are facing any eye-related problems, consult our medical professionals.Consult Now!","Living With Keratitis 

With proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment including follow-up care, keratitis can usually be managed without causing permanent visual disturbances. A continuous evaluation of the eyes by a general practitioner is advised, if you have eye-related signs or symptoms that worry you. Depending on the type and severity of your symptoms, your doctor may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist). 


In case a person is using contact lenses, and eyes become red and inflamed, promptly remove your contact lenses. Avoid touching eyes and rubbing eyes as it can often lead to infection. Always lubricate eyes with eye drops as it helps ease the symptoms of keratitis.


Be sure to follow your healthcare provider's advice about wearing, cleaning, and storing your contact lenses. 


Always wash hands before handling contact lenses, and remove them before sleeping or swimming.


In case of a viral infection, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly with an antiseptic  before touching your eyes. 


Contact your eye doctor immediately if you experience redness, eye pain, or blurry vision.

","Alternative Therapies Of Keratitis

Homeopathic treatment for keratitis 
Homeopathic medicines play a supportive role in keratitis and can be used along with conventional treatment for effective relief from symptoms like pain, burning, and discharge. Here are a few homeopathic medicines for keratitis:


Belladonna: This is a natural medicine which is prepared from the plant called deadly nightshade. Belladonna is the most frequently used remedy in eye troubles like eye redness and congestion.  


Apis mellifica: It is a natural remedy for treating pain in the eyes due to keratitis. The key features for using Apis mellifica include pain which may be stinging, tearing, lancinating, or shooting in nature. 


Euphrasia: This is a homeopathic medicine for keratitis prepared from the plant Euphrasia Officinalis, also known as eye-bright. Euphrasia is useful in the case of keratitis where there is excessive secretion of tears and intense photophobia. 


Pulsatilla: A homeopathic cure for eye discharges in keratitis prepared from the fresh plant Pulsatilla nigricans. It is used in case of eye discharge, burning and itchy eyes, and sticky eyelids in the morning.  

","Complications Of Keratitis 

Early treatment can make you recover quickly from keratitis. However, delayed treatment may lead to serious complications including: 
1. Corneal scars
Trauma, infections, or degenerative conditions can cause corneal scars which can lead to loss or reduction in vision.
2. Long-term inflammation
Keratitis is an inflammatory disorder of the cornea. Depending on the layer of cornea affected, the symptoms and complications are different. Inflammation in the stroma (middle layer of the cornea), can lead to permanent scarring. In some cases, the scars fade enough for the vision to return to normal. However, inflammation in the endothelium, or the innermost layer of the cornea, may cause long-term vision impairment depending on the extent of damage.
3. Corneal ulcers
Chronic corneal inflammation and scarring can lead to recurrent viral infections in your cornea. This often leads to open sores on the cornea (corneal ulcers) and can predispose to temporary or permanent reduction of vision.
4. Recurring infections 
When keratitis is not treated for a longer period of time it leads to recurring infections. Keratitis may or may not be associated with an infection. 
5. Glaucoma 
Rarely keratitis can lead to glaucoma, a condition when the eye’s optic nerve is damaged with or without raised intraocular pressure. This can lead to gradual vision loss.
6. Loss of vision 
Most cases of keratitis can be treated without loss of vision. However, some cases of severe infection can lead to serious complications that may permanently damage vision.",,

","Symptoms Of Keratosis pilaris
Keratosis pilaris (KP) is a common skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of tiny bumps on the skin. These bumps look similar to that of a plucked chicken or goosebumps, giving it the name “plucked chicken skin” and “goosebump skin”. 
The bumps became more prominent during the winter season due to dry skin. These bumps appear as episodes of flare-ups and can disappear later on. This cycle can continue throughout life making it a chronic condition. 

Characteristics of bumps


Feel dry and rough


Occasionally itch


Appear in different colors such as color of the skin, white, red, pinkish purple (on fair skin), and brownish-black (on dark skin)


Location of the bumps
Bumps can develop on any part of the body but the common locations include:


Upper arms


Front part of the upper thighs


Cheeks


Buttocks (mostly in children)


Trunk


Chest


In severe cases, bumps can be extended to the skin of lower legs and forearms. 
The condition is harmless and non-infectious but impacts psychologically due to its cosmetically displeasing appearance. ","Causes Of Keratosis pilaris

The term keratosis means ‘scaly skin’, and pilaris means ‘hair’.
Keratosis pilaris occurs due to the buildup of “keratin” in hair follicles. Keratin is a protein that protects the skin from environmental damage. It is present in skin, hairs, and nails.
The exact cause of this formation is not known. Mutations (genetic changes) in a protein called filaggrin which plays a role in skin barrier function is mostly thought to cause this.","Risk Factors For Keratosis pilaris

The exact cause of KP is unknown but it may be triggered by several factors. These include:
Age
Children under 2 years of age are more prone to this condition. It is also commonly seen in adolescents and fades away during adulthood.  
Dry skin
Dry skin is the most prominent risk factor for keratosis pilaris. The consistent dryness also makes the symptoms of KP worse by causing itching. 

Here are some uncommon causes of dry skin.Read To Know!
Gender
Women are more prone to this condition due to hormonal fluctuations.
Medical conditions
Some medical conditions increase the risk of developing KP. These include:


Atopic dermatitis


Ichthyosis vulgaris


Asthma


Hay fever


Malnutrition


Diabetes


Obesity


Melanoma (skin cancer)


Down syndrome


Noonan syndrome


Family history
Individuals having a family history of keratosis pilaris are more prone to this condition. Studies also suggest the development of KP is more common in siblings and twins.
Medication
Vemurafenib, a drug used in skin cancer makes the individual more prone to keratosis pilaris.
Season
The bumps become prominent during the winter season. This is most likely due to the reduced moisture content of the air. 

Here are 5 simple skin care tips for dry skin in winter!Tap To Know!","Diagnosis Of Keratosis pilaris

Keratosis pilaris can be easily diagnosed because of  its specific appearance. The common procedure used in diagnosing KP include: 

Medical History and Physical Examination
Almost all cases of keratosis pilaris can be easily diagnosed with physical examination due to its specific bumpy appearance. 
The physician will investigate the onset, appearance, location, symptoms and family history. 
In case of doubt, following confirmatory tests may be performed:
Dermoscopy
It refers to the examination of skin using a high quality magnifying lens and a powerful lighting system (a dermatoscope). It reveals abnormalities of the hair follicle. The dermoscopic findings of keratosis pilaris include:


Increase in the diameter of follicular orifices


Presence of keratin plugs


Coiled or twisted hair follicles


Thin hair shaft 


Dermoscopy is also used to monitor the progress of treatment.
Punch biopsy 
It involves examination of a small sample of tissue of the skin. The sample is collected by cutting the affected area using a circular scalpel. It reveals: 


Clogged hair follicles


Hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin)


Lymphocytic infiltration (build-up of white blood cells on the skin)

","Symptoms Of Kidney Cancer 
A person with kidney cancer may or may not have one or more of the symptoms in the early stages. With time, signs and symptoms may develop which include:


Loss of appetite


Blood in urine (hematuria)


Lower back pain 


A general feeling of poor health


A mass (lump) on the side or lower back


Fever that keeps coming and going 


Feeling tired all the time


These signs and symptoms can be caused by kidney cancer (or another type of cancer), but more often caused by benign conditions. For example, blood in the urine is most often caused by a bladder or urinary tract infection or a kidney stone. Still, if you have any of these symptoms, medical advice is required so that the cause can be found and treated early, if needed. ","Causes Of Kidney Cancer 
Some of the common causes of kidney cancer include:
Mutation in genes 
Cancer is caused by changes in the DNA. DNA is the chemical in our cells that makes up our genes. Some genes that help control when our cells grow, divide into new cells, and stay alive are called oncogenes. Genes that help keep cell division under control or cause cells to die at the right time are called tumor suppressor genes. Cancer can be caused by DNA mutations (changes) that turn on oncogenes or turn off tumor suppressor genes, resulting in cells growing out of control.
Inherited gene mutation 
Certain inherited DNA changes can run in some families and increase the risk of kidney cancer. For example, a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene VHL is the gene that causes von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. When the VHL gene is mutated, it is no longer able to control abnormal growth, and kidney cancer is more likely to develop.
Acquired gene mutation 
Some gene mutations occur during a person’s lifetime and are not passed on. They affect only cells that come from the original mutated cell. These DNA changes are called acquired mutations. Obesity, another risk factor for this cancer, alters the balance of some of the body’s hormones. Certain risk factors such as exposure to cancer-causing chemical like those found in tobacco smoke, probably play a role in causing these acquired mutations. ","Risk Factors Of Kidney Cancer
 
A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of getting a disease. Having a risk factor, or even several risk factors, does not mean you will get kidney cancer, but it may increase your risk.Smoking is the most common cause of kidney cancer. Although many risk factors can increase the chance of developing renal cell cancer (RCC), it is not yet clear how some of these risk factors cause kidney cells to become cancerous. 
Non-modifiable risk factors


Age: The incidence of kidney cancer increases with age, with a peak of incidence at approximately 75 years of age.


Sex: The incidence of kidney cancer is two-fold higher in men compared with women. 


Genetic risk factors: Certain rare inherited conditions like von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma or familial renal cancer may have an increased risk of kidney cancer.


Family history of kidney cancer: The risk of kidney cancer increases if first line relatives or close family members have suffered from the condition.


Modifiable risk factors


Overweight/obesity: Obese people are at a higher risk of developing kidney cancer as compared to people who are considered to have a healthy weight. Research shows that high body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be responsible for 26% of kidney cancer cases worldwide.


Tobacco smoking: Smokers have a greater risk of kidney cancer than nonsmokers, with an approximate 30% increased risk in current smokers and a 15% increased risk in former smokers compared with never smokers. 


Environmental and occupational exposure: Environmental exposures such as pesticides, arsenic, cadmium, and lead can increase the risk of kidney cancer. Aaristolochic acid (derived from Aristolochia plants, found in contaminated food, or used in herbal traditional remedies) and trichloroethylene (used as metal cleaner and greaser) are also associated with renal cancer.


Medical history


High blood pressure (hypertension):Hypertension has been found to be associated with a considerable kidney cancer risk. Therefore, controlling the condition through the use of hypertensive medication may be an effective therapeutic intervention in the prevention of kidney cancer. 


Chronic kidney disease and kidney stones: Chronic kidney disease increases the risk of kidney cancer two to three fold.


Diabetes mellitus: Diabetes can leads to obesity and hypertension which predispose to renal cancer.

","Diagnosis Of Kidney Cancer 
 
Kidney cancer might be diagnosed because of signs or symptoms a person is having, or it might be found because of lab tests or imaging tests a person is getting for another reason.
Medical history or physical exam 
If you have any signs or symptoms that suggest you might have kidney cancer, your doctor will take a complete medical history to check for risk factors to learn about your symptoms. A physical exam can provide information about signs of kidney cancer and other health problems. A general practitioner will ask about the medical history of a person: 


Ask you about your symptoms


Examine for any lumps or swelling


Arrange for a blood test to check for signs of a kidney problem


These checks may help diagnose or rule out some possible causes of your symptoms such as a urinary tract infection (UTI).
Blood tests 
Lab tests cannot show for sure if a person has kidney cancer, but they can sometimes give the first hint that there may be a kidney problem. These tests can be done to get a sense of a person’s overall health and to diagnose if cancer might have metastasized (spread) to other areas.  


Urine tests: In urine tests, small amounts of blood can also be detected which is usually not seen with the naked eye. About half of all patients with renal cell cancer will have blood in their urine. If the patient has transitional cell carcinoma (in the renal pelvis, the ureter, or the bladder), sometimes a special test of the urine sample (called urine cytology) will show actual cancer cells in the urine.


Complete blood count (CBC):This test measures the number of different cells in the blood. This test result is often abnormal in people with kidney cancer. Anemia or too few red blood cells is very commonly seen in people with kidney cancer. Less often, a person may have too many red blood cells called polycythemia because the kidney cancer cells make a hormone (erythropoietin) that causes the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. 


Blood chemistry tests: Kidney cancer can affect the levels of certain chemicals in the blood. Blood chemistry tests also measure kidney function, which is especially important, if certain imaging tests or if surgery is planned.


Imaging tests 
These tests can confirm or rule out kidney cancer. If you have cancer, they can help show whether it has spread to other parts of your body.The tests you might have include:


Magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scan: A scan that uses strong magnetic fields and radiowaves to produce a detailed image of your kidneys.


Positron emission tomography (PET) scan: A detailed body scan can be helpful for investigating confirmed cases of kidney cancer to see if cancer has spread and how well it's responding to treatment.


Biopsy: A biopsy might be done to get a small sample of tissue from an area that may be cancerous when the imaging tests are not clear enough to permit surgery. A biopsy may also be done to confirm cancer if a person might not be treated with surgery. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) and needle core biopsy are 2 types of kidney biopsies that may be done. In cases, where the doctors think kidney cancer might have spread to other sites, they may take a biopsy of the metastatic site instead of the kidney.


Ultrasound scan: It is a scan that uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your kidneys. Ultrasound can be helpful in finding a kidney mass and showing if it is solid or filled with fluid. Different ultrasound patterns can also help doctors tell the difference between some types of benign and malignant kidney tumors.


Computed tomography (CT) scan: The CT scan uses x-rays to make detailed cross-sectional images of your body. It can provide precise information about the size, shape, and location of a tumor. It is also useful in checking, if cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or to organs and tissues outside the kidney.


Angiography: In angiography, a contrast dye is injected into the renal artery, and the dye outlines the blood vessels. Angiography can also help diagnose renal cancers since the blood vessels usually have a special appearance with this test.


Bone scan:This test is helpful to check if cancer has spread to the bones. A small amount of low-level radioactive material is injected into the blood which gets collected mainly in abnormal areas of bone. 


Cystoscopy: Where a thin tube is passed up your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of your body) so that problems in the bladder can be detected.


Chest x-ray: An x-ray may be done after kidney cancer has been diagnosed to check if the cancer has spread to the lungs. 

","Specialist To Visit
A general practitioner can evaluate the symptoms and start the treatment. He can further refer to other doctors for assessment depending upon the organ affected. 


Urologist: A urologist is a physician who specializes in diseases of the urinary tract.

Home remedies 

1. Echinacea: It is an immune-boosting plant. The root extract of this plant cleanses the kidneys from heavy metals like cadmium. The echinacea plant has anti-inflammatory effects on the body and is considered an effective herb against kidney cancer. 2. Vitamin D3: A deficiency of Vitamin D is known as one of the risk factors for developing kidney cancer. Vitamin D3 is available in dairy, salmon, sardines, fish oil, cod liver oil, eggs, and mushrooms. 3. Astragalus: It is one of the best herbs known as a kidney restorer but also one of the best anti-cancer immune-building herbs.4. Korean Ginseng: The roots of this plant have been used for health and longevity for thousands of years in traditional chinese medicine. Ginseng reduced the risk of multiple types of cancer by up to 40%. It has been confirmed that ginseng directly inhibits the growth of kidney tumors. 
Diet for kidney cancer individuals 
A kidney cancer diet should include many of the same things found in any healthy diet, with some nutritional add-ons to combat the specific effects of cancer treatment. Daily nutrition should include:1. A lot of whole grains: Whole grains may reduce cancer risk because of their high amounts of fiber, antioxidants, and minerals like Vitamin E and selenium. 2. Fruits and vegetables: Research suggests that fruits and fiber-rich vegetables may have a protective effect against kidney cancer and its recurrence. 3. High caloric intake: If a person is undergoing cancer treatment, include high-calorie foods like peanut butter, milkshakes, sauces, gravies, and meats. These foods are essential for maintaining the weight of a person as cancer treatment leads to weight loss. ",,"Complications Of Kidney Cancer 
The complications arising from kidney cancer are most likely regarding the patient’s mental health. Although it’s not impossible to detect it in somewhat earlier stages, this cancer is most commonly discovered in the considerably advanced ones when there is not much left to do for the person but relieve the pain. It's hard for a person to accept reality and stay in a state of grief, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. There are a number of complications that may occur due to kidney cancer including: 
High blood pressure
Kidneys play an important role in regulating blood pressure. Kidney cancer may result in persistent high blood pressure and at times, blood pressure that is very difficult to control. 
Liver insufficiency 
Kidney cancer may affect the liver by spreading cancer. The liver filters the blood, as does the kidney, the combination of liver and kidney dysfunction can result in the accumulation of toxins in the blood, leading to confusion, personality changes, and mood changes. 
Pleural effusion
When kidney cancer spreads to the lungs or the lining of the lungs, it may cause the build-up of fluid between the membranes lining the lungs called the pleura. Sometimes, a large amount of fluid (several liters) accumulates, causing significant shortness of breath. A procedure called thoracentesis is recommended in some cases, which involves placing a fine needle through the skin on the chest wall and into the pleural cavity to withdraw fluid.
Kidney failure
If a surgery leaves only one functioning kidney, the ongoing medication can put stress on the existing kidney which may lead to kidney failure. If kidney failure occurs, dialysis may be needed or a kidney transplant, if it is an early-stage kidney cancer. ","Alternative Therapies For Kidney Cancer 
 
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to a range of treatments and practices that are not typically part of the standard medical care. It also helps in comforting themselves and easing the worries of cancer treatment and related stress. Alternative therapies help in coping with the side effects of cancer treatments such as nausea, pain, and fatigue. 
Mind therapies 
These combine mental focus, breathing, and body movements to help relax the body and mind. These include: 


Meditation: It involves focused breathing or chanting of words or phrases to calm the mind.


Yoga: It is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that originated in ancient India. It helps in stretching and calming the body. 


Tai Chi: It includes slow, gentle movements with focus on the breath and concentration.


Body-based practices 


Massage: The purpose of massage is generally for the treatment of body stress or pain. The soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed, tapped, and stroked.


Chiropractic therapy: It is a branch of study that focuses on nerves, bones, and other parts of the neuro-musculoskeletal system. This is a good alternative to invasive alternatives like surgery or injections for treating short-term or chronic pain.


Biofield therapies 
Biofield therapies are non-invasive therapies in which the practitioner explicitly works with a client's biofield (interacting fields of energy and information that surround living systems) to stimulate healing responses in patients.


Reiki: It is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is believed that improving the flow of energy around the body can enable relaxation, relieve pain, speed healing, and reduce other symptoms of illness.


Therapeutic touch: This is a holistic, evidence-based practice that incorporates the intentional and compassionate use of universal energy to promote balance and well-being.


Whole medical system 
These are healing systems and beliefs that have evolved over time in different cultures and parts of the world. In India, the goal is to cleanse the body and restore balance to the body, mind, and spirit. Some examples are:


Acupuncture: It is a common practice in Chinese medicine that involves stimulating certain points in the body to promote health or to lessen disease symptoms and treatment side effects.


Naturopathic treatment: It involves various methods that help the body naturally heal itself. An example would be herbal treatment. 

","Living With Kidney Cancer 

Watching for recurrence 
One goal of follow-up care is to check for a recurrence, which means that cancer has come back. Cancer recurs because small areas of cancer cells may remain undetected in the body. Over time, these cells may increase in number until they show up on test results or cause signs or symptoms.During follow-up, a doctor will ask specific questions about your health and prescribe specific blood tests or imaging tests. Testing is done considering various factors such as type and stage of cancer first diagnosed and the types of treatment given.
Managing long-term and late side effects 
Most people experience side effects while receiving treatment. However, it is often that the side effects may linger beyond the treatment period. These are called long-term side effects. Other side effects called late effects may develop months or even years later. Long-term and late effects can include both physical and emotional changes. Cancer in itself is a serious condition and this can easily affect the mental health of the patient as well as the caregiver too. Stress, anxiety, or depression can both affect physically and mentally. In this case, supportive emotional and mental health care can be a great help for anyone struggling to cope with kidney cancer.
Keeping personal health records 
Doctors design a treatment plan for the cancer treatment and the survivor should also keep track of the cancer treatment received when treatment is completed. This helps the doctor and family to deal with the emergency condition and to look back at the medical history, treatment received, medications given and duration of treatment. 
Diet and nutrition 
A healthy diet and good nutrition are essential for kidney cancer patients to maintain strength, protect body tissues from breaking down, prevent infection, and promote tissue regeneration, especially while undergoing therapy. Dietary and nutritional needs may change over the course of kidney cancer depending on the stage, type of treatment, response, and other factors. Avoiding excess sugar, maintaining weight, and eating a well-balanced nutritious diet are of utmost significance.
Physical activity 
Exercise and physical activity can have a variety of benefits for kidney cancer patients from helping regain muscle tone following surgery to reducing and managing stress and promoting good cardiovascular health. "

","Symptoms Of Kidney Failure
 
Patients who have early stage kidney failure may not even notice their symptoms since the signs are quite often not noticeable. The Centre For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that as much as 90 % of people with chronic kidney disease are not aware that they have the disease. The symptoms associated with renal failure tend to worsen with time. Some of the symptoms that may be seen in renal failure are:


Swelling of legs, feet or ankles due to retention of fluids 


Excessive drowsiness


Increased fatigue 


Shortness of breath


Reduced urine output


Persistent nausea


Pain or pressure in the chest 


Muscle spasm 


Metallic taste 


Irregular heartbeat


Irregular sleep pattern


Back pain


Fever


Rash


Diarrhea


Pain in the abdomen


Seizures


Coma 


Early signs of kidney failure are less noticeable and include the following symptoms such as: 


Swelling of limbs due to fluid retention 


Shortness of breath


Reduced urine output 


A change in color of urine can act as an early sign of damage to your kidneys and the subsequent progress of the condition. 


Pale yellow or clear urine: This indicates that your body is well hydrated and it’s the ideal color in most cases. 




Dark yellow or amber colored urine: Drinking less amount of water can cause your urine to look slightly darker in color than normal. This indicates dehydration and can be treated by drinking your fluids while cutting down on sodas, tea or coffee. 




Tint of red or pink colored urine: If you find your urine to have this colour, then it's a sign of concern. The red tint could be blood and may indicate a medical condition. Eating food like beets or strawberries can also be the reason for red colored urine. In such conditions, talk to your doctor and take a urine test. 




Orange colored urine: This is also a sign of dehydration. It can indicate the presence of accumulated bile in your bloodstream. Orange colored urine is usually not caused due to a kidney disease. 




Foamy urine: It may indicate the presence of protein in the urine, which is a sign of a kidney disease.

","Types Of Kidney Failure

Kidney failure can be of two types namely:


Acute kidney failure: Also called acute renal failure or acute kidney injury, it develops rapidly, usually in less than a few days and is potentially reversible. It generally occurs in individuals who are already hospitalised, especially the critically ill patients .




Chronic kidney failure: This type progresses slowly over at least three months and can lead to permanent kidney damage. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, the patient may notice only a few signs or symptoms and not realise that he/she has kidney disease until the condition is advanced.


 ",,,"Diagnosis Of Kidney Failure
There are several tests that can help your doctor in the diagnosis of acute renal failure. Some of the common tests include the following:

1. Urinalysis
Your doctor may order a urinalysis for which you'll be asked to take a urine sample. The test is ordered if your doctor suspects anything unusual such as the presence of atypical proteins or sugar in the urine. The urine sample is further sent to a lab where an urine analysis is performed. A urinary sedimentation test is carried out to detect the presence of red and white blood cells, a number of tube-shaped bacterias known as cellular casts or levels of bacteria. Extremely heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/d) can occasionally be seen in glomerulonephritis (swelling and redness of the tiny filters in the kidneys called glomeruli), vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), or toxins.Urine eosinophils have a limited role in differential diagnosis, they can be seen in interstitial nephritis (spaces between the kidney tubules become swollen), pyelonephritis (a type of urinary tract infection), cystitis (inflammation of urinary bladder), atheroembolic disease (when plaque from large arteries go and block small arteries like renal artery), or glomerulonephritis.The finding of oxalate crystals in acute kidney injury should prompt an evaluation for ethylene glycol toxicity.
2. Urine volume measurements
Urine output measurement is one of the easiest tests that can help in the diagnosis of kidney failure. Low urinary output may indicate the presence of kidney diseases due to a blockage. The blockage can be caused due to an underlying pathology or injury. 
3. Blood tests
You may be ordered to take blood samples through which your doctor can identify the presence and quantity of substances present in your urine. Kidneys filter substances such as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. The varying levels of these substances can give an idea about your health and the functioning of your kidney. A rapid rise in the level of these compounds can indicate acute kidney failure. These tests include:


Creatinine: A compound made by your muscles, in particular, can help in the identification of kidney failure since a normal kidney would remove creatinine from the blood and excrete it via urine. 


Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): Urea is another waste product found in your blood. It is created from protein when broken down. It is also removed from your blood via the kidneys. Blood samples can detect the level of urea nitrogen. 


Electrolytes: Electrolytes like potassium and sodium help with fluid balance in your body. A high level of sodium can be an indication that your kidneys aren't functioning properly since your body is unable to excrete the right amount of sodium. 


4. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
It is a test used to check how well the kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli each minute. Glomeruli are the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood.The lab specialist combines your blood creatinine level with several other factors to estimate your GFR. Different formulas are used for adults and children. The formula includes some or all of the following:


Age


Blood creatinine measurement


Ethnicity


Sex


Height


Weight


The creatinine clearance test, which involves a 24-hour urine collection, can also provide an estimate of kidney function.According to the National Kidney Foundation, normal results range from 90 to 120 mL/min/1.73 m2. Older people will have lower than normal GFR levels because GFR decreases with age.Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.Levels below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 3 or more months are a sign of chronic kidney disease. A GFR lower than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 is a sign of kidney failure and requires immediate medical attention.

5. Imaging

Different imaging modalities such as MRI, ultrasound, and CT scan can be recommended at different stages of a disease, depending on your symptoms and signs. These imaging tests can help your doctor identify blockages or other problems that might be affecting your kidney and urinary tract. 

6. Biopsy
A kidney tissue biopsy is recommended to collect a small sample of the kidney tissue. This exam helps in the identification of scarring, infectious organisms, or the presence of any other deposits. ","Prevention Of Kidney Failure

You can reduce your risk of developing renal failure by adopting some healthy lifestyle changes. While taking over-the-counter pills such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and over-the-counter pain medications such as acetaminophen, make sure to reach the prescription label and follow the recommended dosage instructions. Taking too much of these medications can increase your risk of developing renal failure. If you are at a higher risk of developing renal failure due to pre-existing conditions, make sure to consult your doctor before taking new medications. Talk to your doctor and follow their advice for managing your condition. Exercising right and avoiding alcohol can go a long way in reducing your risk of developing renal failure. ","Specialist To Visit
You should visit a doctor if you are experiencing symptoms such as trouble keeping your blood pressure levels within a normal range even after taking the directed medications, your blood sugar levels are fluctuating within a wide range, fluid retention that is causing swelling in your feet or ankles, shortness of breath, nausea, chest pain, and seizures. These symptoms might indicate the possibility of renal failure. You can consult the following doctors for diagnosis:

Treatment for renal failure usually requires hospitalisation. Typically people who develop renal failure are already hospitalised due to underlying pathology or pre-existing medical conditions. The duration of your stay depends on the severity of your condition and the reason behind your kidney failure. Your doctor will monitor how quickly your kidneys are recovering and decide when to discharge you accordingly. In some cases, you might be able to recover at home. 

Treatment of the cause

If you have developed kidney failure due to an injury to your kidneys or illness that has damaged your kidney, identifying and treating the underlying cause will help in the management of kidney failure. Your treatment options will depend on the cause and severity of the condition. 

Treatments to balance the level of fluids in your body

Your renal failure may be caused due to a lack of fluids in the blood. This would require intravenous fluids. Sometimes an excess of fluids may cause renal failure that usually leads to fluid retention causing swelling of lower extremities such as legs and ankles. In such cases, a physician recommends medications called diuretics that help the body in expelling excessive fluids. Ultrafiltration may be required for patients who are not responding to diuretics.
Elimination of nephrotoxic drugs and substances
Elimination or replacement with non-nephrotoxic alternatives can be done for medications like angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) by your doctor. 

Medications to control blood potassium
Potassium is a salt that helps in regulating vital functions of your body. Excessive levels of potassium can cause an irregular heartbeat that can lead to severe complications and muscle fatigue. If your kidneys are unable to filter potassium from your blood, your doctor may ask you to restrict dietary potassium and prescribe you sodium polystyrene sulfonate, glucose along with insulin, or calcium to prevent the levels of potassium from rising in your blood. 

Medication to regulate calcium levels 
In case your calcium levels drop, your doctor may recommend a calcium infusion to prevent complications.

Dialysis 

This is a procedure that filters and purifies the toxins from your blood through a machine. Essentially, the functions of your kidneys are taken over by the machine. Depending on the kind of dialysis recommended by your doctor, you may be connected to a big machine or you may be asked to use a portable catheter bag. There are two types of dialysis:


Hemodialysis: For hemodialysis, a catheter (tube) will be inserted into one of the veins present in your legs or neck. The machine will regularly clean your blood. People on hemodialysis are recommended to receive treatment around three to four times a week at a dialysis centre or hospital. 




Peritoneal dialysis: This dialysis cleans the blood using a dialysis solution and a catheter. A tube is inserted into your belly that takes out excessive fluids, salt, and potassium. This fluid is removed from the body and can be done via an automated exchanger while you are asleep. Most children who have renal failure are recommended for peritoneal dialysis.


Kidney transplant 
A kidney transplant is a procedure where a specialist operates on the patient and replaces a non-functional kidney with a functional kidney from a healthier person. Patients with end-stage renal disease are advised to go through with a kidney transplant as that is the best treatment option available for them. Living donors are easier to find since most of them are family members of the patient. The process of finding a living donor is usually faster. There is typically a long wait to find a donor kidney that is compatible with the patient's body. The patient undergoing the surgery may have to take immunosuppressant drugs for some time after the surgery to prevent the body from rejecting the new kidney. These drugs have side effects which need constant monitoring. ","Home-care For Kidney Failure

Kidney failure needs rigorous attention and monitoring. Here are a few tips to follow at home:


If you have been prescribed medications to manage your medical condition, make sure you take those medications on time.


Label your drugs and set the alarm to make sure you have the medicines every day at the same time. Follow all the instructions given to you by your doctor.


Follow the diet given to you by your doctor.


Follow the diet given by your dietician that is customised depending on your medical condition and more compatible with your kidneys. 


Stick to the right treatment plan, as decided by your doctor, and incorporate the necessary lifestyle changes to recover faster. 


Eat a balanced diet and cut back on alcohol or foods that damage your kidneys. 

","Complications Of Kidney Failure

Renal Failure can lead to several complications which include the following:

Bone and muscle weakness

Disruption of minerals like calcium and phosphorus due to renal failure can lead to complications such as the weakening of bones. If your electrolytes are out of balance you can also develop muscle weakness that can cause heart rhythm problems or even paralysis. 
Uremia
Buildup of nitrogenous waste products in the body is seen in kidney failure. At higher concentrations, changes in mental status and bleeding complications might arise.

Anemia 
If your kidneys aren't functioning properly, this can lead to anemia, a condition in which a person has a low red blood cell count. Although there are multiple factors that lead to anemia in kidney failure, the primary cause is thought to be the insufficient levels of erythropoietin -- a hormone secreted by the kidneys that helps in production of red blood cells.

Fluid retention 
Kidneys are responsible for filtering out excess water out of your blood and removing toxins along with it. In case of renal failure, you may be at an increased risk of fluid retention that can cause swelling of the lower extremities. 

Heart disease

Kidney failure can lead to heart diseases. Heart diseases most commonly cause death in people who are on dialysis. Inflammation of the lining of the heart can lead to chest pain. 

Metabolic acidosis 
Renal failure can lead to excessive acid in the blood that can cause nausea, drowsiness, breathlessness, and vomiting. It can also lead to kidney stones and bone diseases. 

Electrolyte imbalance
The dysfunctional kidney has limited ability to regulate electrolyte imbalance. Hyponatremia (low levels of sodium in blood) and hyperkalemia (increased potassium concentration in blood) are important abnormalities seen as a result of kidney failure. 

Cardiac complications

The major cardiac complications are arrhythmias (irregular heart beats), pericarditis (inflammation of the heart membrane), and pericardial effusion (fluid build up in the pericardium). In addition, volume overload and uremia may lead to direct cardiac injury and impaired cardiac function. 

Malnutrition
Patients with long term kidney disease are at a high risk for malnutrition, characterised by decreased body stores of protein and energy fuels along with micronutrient deficiencies. 
Calciphylaxis
It is a rare and serious condition seen almost exclusively in patients with advanced CKD. It is characterised by accumulation of calcium in small blood vessels of the skin and fatty tissues.

Secondary complications 
Some people can develop secondary complications such as: 


Fluid buildup in the lungs


Nerve damage


Depression 


Liver failure


Gout (increased levels of uric acid)


Skin infections


Diabetic nephropathy

","Symptoms Of Kidney Stones 
Kidney stones vary in size. While tiny stones are less likely to get stuck in the kidneys or other parts of the urinary tract, bigger stones can cause sharp, cramping pain in the back and the sides. This feeling often moves to the lower abdomen or groin. The pain may last for a short or long time or come and go but can be quite intense.Symptoms of kidney stones include:


Pink, red, or brown blood in your urine, also called hematuria


Pain during urination


Cloudy or bad-smelling urine


A constant need to urinate


Chills 


Fever


For men, pain at the tip of the penis


Vague pain or stomach ache that doesn't go away


Nausea


Vomiting

",,"Causes Of Kidney Stones 
Kidney stones are caused when the levels of minerals like calcium, oxalate, and phosphorus rise in the urine. Other factors that cause the development of kidney stones in the body include:


Dehydration


Obesity


Diet (high in oxalate or uric acid)


Eating an excess of salt or sugar


Lack of exercise


High concentrated urine


Imbalance of pH in urine


Regular constipation


Genetic disorders

","Risk Factors Of Kidney StonesAge and sex

Kidney stones are most likely to occur in people between the ages of 20 and 50 years. It has been found that men are much more likely to develop these stones than women.
Family or personal history
Someone with a family history of kidney stones is more likely to develop the stones than someone without a family history. 
The risk of the development of kidney stones is also three times higher in a person with a personal history of kidney stones.
Diet 


Diet that is high in sodium, protein and sugar can increase the risk of certain types of kidney stones.


Inadequate amount of calcium in the diet is a major risk factor for the development of kidney stones. Low calcium diets increase urinary oxalate excretion, which may result in more stone formation and possibly a negative calcium balance.


Dehydration
This is the most common cause and may come from the loss of body fluids due to excessive exercise, working, or living in a hot place.
Obesity
Obesity may change the acid levels in the urine, leading to stone formation. High body mass index (BMI), large waist size, and weight gain have all been associated with an increased risk of both a single episode and recurrent episodes of kidney stones.
What is body mass index? Learn more about it and how to calculate it.Tap Now
Urinary tract infections
In patients with chronic urinary tract infections, larger stones may form in the kidney. These are commonly called a struvite or infection stones.
Medical conditions 
Some medical conditions have an increased risk of kidney stones. Abnormal growth of one or more parathyroid glands, which control calcium metabolism, can cause high calcium levels in the blood and urine. Another condition called distal renal tubular acidosis, in which there is acid build-up in the body can raise the risk of calcium phosphate kidney stones.
Medications
Some medications, calcium and vitamin C supplements, may increase your risk of forming stones. These include:

Certain antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and sulfa antibiotics
Certain diuretics, like triamterene, which are used to treat high blood pressure 
Decongestants, like ephedrine or guaifenesin

Protease inhibitors, like indinavir

Anticonvulsants, like felbamate, topiramate, and zonisamide

Small kidney stones
These stones are typically excreted out from the body on their own without considerable treatment. Intake of sufficient amounts of water (4-5 liters a day) may help flush out the stone via the urine. Different medications that can be used for assistance during the removal of these stones are:
Medications 


Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These are used to relieve the pain caused by the stone movement. A few examples include:




Aspirin 


Diclofenac


Ketoprofen




Anti-sickness medicine: These drugs are used in case of nausea and vomiting. They include:




Cinnarizine


Hyoscine


Chlorpromazine




Alpha-blockers : They help in relaxing the muscles of the ureter and facilitate the passage of stones from the kidney. These drugs are:




Tamsulosin 


Alfuzosin


Nifedipine


Doxazosin


Terazosin




Diuretics: These drugs increase the urine flow, and may also flush out the stone of <5 mm in size. Examples of a few diuretics are:




Bumetanide 


Ethacrynic acid 


Furosemide 


Torsemide 


Large kidney stones
If the kidney stones are too big to be passed naturally, they're usually removed by surgery.
Surgery


Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL): This is the only non-invasive method for stone removal. SWL involves the usage of ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to pinpoint where a kidney stone is, and the ultrasound waves break the stone into smaller pieces. SWL needs more than one session to successfully treat kidney stones.

Ureteroscopy (URS): This method is used for stones in the ureter, especially for stones closest to the bladder, in the lower half of the ureter. It involves passing a long, thin telescope, called a ureteroscope, through the tube urine passes through on its way out of the body (the urethra) and into your bladder. URS is a preferred method for the treatment of small to medium-sized kidney stones located in any part of the urinary tract.

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): PCNL is used most often when kidney stones are too difficult to reach, too large, too numerous, or too dense to be treated by shock wave lithotripsy or ureteroscopy. PCNL is considered the first-choice treatment for renal stones >2 cm.

Medications 
Certain medications are also prescribed along with surgeries for larger stones, depending on the type of stone:


Calcium stones: Thiazide diuretics (often called water pills, which help rid your body of water) are used for patients with calcium stones. Another salt used to inhibit the formation of calcium stones is potassium citrate.

Uric acid stones: This condition is also called hyperuricemia or hyperuricosuria. Allopurinol, which is frequently prescribed for gout, is also used to lower the level of uric acid in the blood and urine.

Struvite stones: Acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) is used for patients with struvite infection. AHA can dilute the urine and make it unfavorable for the formation of struvite stones. 

Cystine stones: Cystine-binding thiol drugs are used only for patients in whom cystine stones are formed. These medications (d-penicillamine or tiopronin) bind to cystine in the urine and form a compound that is less likely to crystallize than cystine.

Hyperparathyroidism surgery
People with hyperparathyroidism, a condition that results in too much calcium in the blood, sometimes develop calcium stones. Removing the parathyroid gland cures hyperparathyroidism and can prevent kidney stones. Hyperparathyroidism can cause many symptoms in the body, including unexplained weight loss.

 ","Home-care For Kidney Stones 
Here are a few home remedies that can help in managing kidney stones: 


Lemon juice (Nimbu): Lemons contain citrate, which is a chemical that prevents calcium stones from forming. Citrate can also break up small stones, allowing them to pass more easily. Consumption of half cup of lemon juice per day will increase citrates in the urine.


Water consumption: Drinking water helps speed up the process of passing a stone. Drink at least 12 glasses of water if you are trying to pass a kidney stone. 


Green tea: Green tea is rich in antioxidants and possesses a protective effect against the development of calcium stones in the kidneys.


Kidney beans (Rajma): High levels of fiber in kidney beans and broth from cooked kidney beans help improve overall urinary and kidney health. It also helps dissolve and flush out kidney stones. 


Celery: It has antispasmodic (that suppresses muscle spasms) properties and also helps in cleansing the toxins from the body.


Dandelion: Organic dandelion roots help cleanse the kidneys and support normal kidney functioning. Taking 500 mg of dried dandelion extract or drinking dandelion tea may help ease the symptoms and prevent the formation of kidney stones.




Wheatgrass: It is a rich source of many vital nutrients. A glass of wheatgrass juice with lemon extract is a perfect way to sort out kidney stones.




Pomegranate juice (Anar): This juice acts as a natural detoxifying agent that helps get rid of kidney stones causing impurities. Try to consume fresh pomegranate juice each day without added sugar. 


Raspberry: This fruit is capable of expelling stones from the urinary tract. The prophylactic effect of raspberry has been reported on calcium oxalate renal stone formation.


Fenugreek seeds (Methi dana): It has been usually seen that fenugreek seeds significantly reduce calcification in the kidneys and help prevent kidney stones.


Black cumin seed (Jeera): This herb significantly reduces the formation of calcium oxalate stones.


Radish (Mooli): Roots of radish plant are highly effective in breaking kidney stones.


Tamarind pulp (Imli): Tamarind has shown beneficial effect in inhibiting spontaneous crystallization during the formation of kidney stones.




Baking soda: It helps in maintaining an alkaline environment in the body. The stones get enhanced in an acidic environment and baking soda aids in their removal. Mix half a teaspoon of the baking soda with apple cider vinegar and consume the solution twice a day.

","Symptoms Of Lactose Intolerance

The symptoms of lactose intolerance usually begin 30 minutes to 2 hours after consuming lactose-containing products. The undigested lactose build up in the intestine and cause:


Abdominal pain


Bloating


Loose stools


Flatulence


Borborygmi (a rumbling or gurgling noise made by the movement of fluid and gas in the intestines)


Fullness



Rarely, the individual may also experience:


Nausea


Vomiting


Headache


Constipation


Muscle pain


Joint pain



The malabsorption of lactose produces several toxic chemicals such as acetone, acetaldehyde, ethanol, and peptides. This can lead to the appearance of some extra-intestinal symptoms which include:


Memory deterioration


Musculoskeletal pain


Depression


Anxiety


Mouth ulcers


Heart rhythm disorders


Vertigo



Did you know?
The amount of lactose usually required to produce symptoms of lactose intolerance is about 8 to 12 oz (236 to 354 ml). However, the amount may vary from person to person.","Causes Of Lactose Intolerance 

What is lactose?
Lactose is a type of sugar present in the milk of humans and mammals except for sea lions and walruses. It is also present in the products derived from milk such as cheese and yogurt. Breast milk and cow’s milk contain approximately 7.2 g of lactose per 100 ml and cow’s milk contains about 5g of lactose per 100 ml respectively. 
During infancy, it provides a very good source of energy that helps in overall growth and development.
Interesting fact!Lactose is the only sugar that does not increase the risk of dental caries.
How does the lactose digested and absorbed in the body?
The enzyme lactase present in the small intestine plays a very key role in the digestion of lactose.
Lactose contains two types of sugar molecules i.e. glucose and galactose. In the small intestine, lactose is broken down into these two simple sugars. The glucose is absorbed in the body and used as an energy source.
How does lactose intolerance take place?
The main cause of lactose intolerance is the deficiency or the inactivity of the lactase enzyme.
What happens if Lactose is not digested?


Accumulation of lactose in the large intestine


Bacteria present in the large intestine ferments lactose and produce gasses including hydrogen (H2 ), carbon dioxide (CO2 ), methane (CH4 ) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). 


These gases affect the GI function and manifest as the symptoms mentioned above. 


What is the difference between lactose intolerance and cow’s milk allergy?
Cow’s milk allergy is a type of immune mediated reaction unlike lactose intolerance which occurs primarily due to the deficiency in lactase enzyme. The symptoms of lactose intolerance start to appear at 5-6 years of age in contrast to milk allergy which peaks during the first year of life. The distinguishing symptoms are skin rashes and swelling of the lips, tongue, and palate which are very less likely to appear in lactose intolerance. ","Types Of Lactose Intolerance 

There are four type of lactose intolerance depending upon the cause: 
Congenital lactose intolerance


The congenital form is very rare and  characterized by absent or reduced activity of lactase enzyme from birth. 


It is a lifelong disorder that is manifested through the very first time the infant consumes either breast milk or formula.


Developmental lactose intolerance


It is seen in premature infants who are born at 28 to 37 weeks of gestation. 


The premature infants have an underdeveloped intestine which leads to malabsorption of lactose. 


Primary lactose intolerance


It is the most common cause of lactose intolerance, also known as adult type lactase deficiency.


Normally, there is a gradual decline in lactase enzyme activity after weaning –the process of switching an infant's diet from breast milk or formula to other foods and fluids. But, in some individuals the activity of the lactase enzyme persists in adulthood also. Those in which the activity does not persist will lead to lactose intolerance.


Secondary lactase deficiency


It occurs later in life due to some gastrointestinal illness such as gastroenteritis, giardiasis, or celiac disease. 


These diseases damage the brush border of the small intestine that contains lactase enzymes. 


It is usually reversible. 

","Diagnosis Of Lactose Intolerance

The diagnosis of lactose intolerance requires assessing the medical, family, and dietary history of the patient. The understanding of clinical history also helps in revealing the association between the ingestion of lactose and occurrence of symptoms.
Medical history is followed by physical examination in which signs of abdominal pain, tenderness, and bloating are evaluated. 
The commonly used tests for the diagnosis of lactose intolerance include:
1. Lactose breath test (hydrogen breath test)
This test is most commonly used for the diagnosis of lactose intolerance. It involves breathing into a balloon-type container every 30 minutes over a few hours, to measure the amount of hydrogen in the breath. High amount of hydrogen gas indicates the presence of undigested lactose, a marker of lactose intolerance.
However, certain factors can affect the test result by altering the intestinal bacteria flora:


Use of some specific medications oral antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and aspirin


Abuse of laxatives (stool softeners)


Invasive procedures that require bowel cleansing with enemas


Use of probiotics before the test


Consumption of some foods such as beans, corn, white wheat, potatoes, and oats


2. Lactose tolerance test
This test measures the amount of glucose at regular intervals after consuming 50 gm lactose containing liquid. Readings are taken at 0, 60, and 120 minutes. The failure of the blood glucose levels to rise by 20g may indicate lactose intolerance. 
The test has good sensitivity except in some conditions such as diabetes and small bacterial overgrowth. However, the test is useful in instances where there is absence of bacteria that does not produce hydrogen and hydrogen breath test can not be utilized. Note: The measurement of breath hydrogen after ingestion of 25 to 50 g of lactose is more sensitive and specific than the lactose intolerance test.
3. Milk tolerance test
Normally, lactose is digested and absorbed as glucose. Lactose intolerance is characterized by malabsorption of glucose. In this test, 500 ml of milk is given to the individual followed by testing of blood sugar. A rise in blood sugar of less than 9 mg/dl indicates lactose intolerance. 
4. Stool acidity test
This test measures the pH of stool. Lactose intolerance is characterized by decrease in the pH of the stool. 
5. Bowel biopsy 
In this, a small portion of the small intestine is removed for examination. Any damage in the cells of the small intestine that produce lactase enzyme is checked. This test is invasive and hence it is rarely performed. It is also used to rule out secondary causes of lactose intolerance. ",,"Prevention Of Lactose Intolerance 

Lactose intolerance is predominantly a genetic condition without many modifiable factors. However, dietary modification plays a crucial role in the avoidance of symptoms associated with lactose tolerance.
Studies suggest that adults can consume up to 12 g of lactose in a single dose with no or minimal symptoms. So, it is always advisable to look at the content of lactose in the serving before having. The following list includes food items to be limited and those that are allowed:
Foods to limit


All kinds of milk: whole, low fat, non-fat, cream, powdered, condensed, evaporated, goat, acidophilus, and chocolate 


Milk products like butter, cottage cheese, ice cream, creamy/cheesy sauces, cream cheeses, soft cheeses (brie, ricotta), mozzarella, whipped cream, frozen yogurt 


Milk and food items made from milk are not the only source of lactose. Lactose is also added in several foods to incorporate sweetness and softness. Individuals with severe intolerance should be aware about these products. Such food items with ‘Hidden Lactose’ include:


Milk Bread 


Baked goods like muffins, biscuit, waffle, pancake


Processed breakfast cereals


Mixes for cakes, pancakes, biscuits, and cookies


Instant potatoes, soups, and breakfast drinks


Margarine


Salad dressings

The treatment approach of lactose intolerance should be aimed to provide symptomatic relief along with improving the metabolism of lactose. 
Objective of treatment 


To provide symptomatic relief 


To increase the absorption of lactose


To avoid the nutritional deficiencies of restricted diet


To treat the underlying condition in people with secondary lactase deficiency


Treatment approaches


Minimizing the lactose intake


Using alternative nutrient substitutes


Using enzymatic supplements or lactase supplements


Retaining the amount of calcium and Vitamin D


Dietary modification


The maximum tolerable dose of lactose is identified. This is done by avoiding lactose-containing dairy products for 2-4 weeks. It is followed by a reintroduction of dairy products that are low in lactose. The dose is gradually increased to determine the tolerable which the individual can safely consume without the occurrence of symptoms.


Foods to be limited and those that are allowed have been discussed in the prevention section.


Lactase enzyme supplements


Patients with mild lactose malabsorption may benefit from using lactase enzyme supplements. These supplements are taken whenever food containing lactose is consumed. 


The main advantage of this treatment approach is that individuals can consume dairy products. This will not deprive the patient from nutritional benefits of milk products and avoid the risk of osteoporosis and other bone related disorders. 


Probiotics 


Probiotics contain lactase-producing bacteria that help in the digestion of lactose.


A significant amount of reduction is seen in the symptoms of lactose intolerance due to probiotics.

What causes latex allergy?
Allergies are caused when the body’s immunity responds abnormally to an external trigger known as an ‘allergen,’ which does not usually incite an immune response in most other humans.
There are hundreds of allergens found in natural rubber latex. The chemicals added to latex during its processing can also cause latex allergy. 
How is the person exposed to latex?
An individual can be exposed to latex through:


Direct exposure through the skin, mucus membranes, or intravenously 


Contamination of food through gloves used by food handlers during preparation or serving


Inhaling latex powder through the lungs


What happens upon exposure to latex in hypersensitive individuals?
Once latex enters the bloodstream, it releases IgE antibodies (proteins that protect you when an unwanted substance enters your body). These antibodies bind to the allergic proteins found in latex. The binding releases several chemicals that elicit an immune response characterized by symptoms described in the next section.","Symptoms Of Latex Allergy
The symptoms of latex allergy starts within a few minutes to four days after exposure to latex. The classical symptoms include:


Hives


Itching


Blisters on the back of the hand


Runny nose


Scratchy throat


Sneezing


Conjunctivitis


 
It can also cause asthma symptoms such as: 


Coughing


Wheezing 


Chest tightness

Latex allergy is of two types:
1. Delayed (type IV) hypersensitive reaction


The type IV hypersensitivity to latex results in an allergic contact dermatitis when exposed to latex.


Symptoms of delayed reaction usually developed 24 to 48 hours after the exposure. 


The most common sources of type IV latex allergy are gloves for adults and shoe soles for children. 


2. Immediate (type 1) hypersensitivity- IgE mediated


It is the most serious allergic reaction as it can prove to be fatal in the absence of treatment.


It is caused due to the release of antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE) that are specific for latex proteins.


The increase in IgE triggers the release of histamine and other mediators that cause symptoms related to latex allergy. Symptoms generally begin within minutes of exposure.

",,,"Specialist To Visit
If you experience recurrent symptoms such as sneezing, skin rash, or chest tightness after exposure to latex, you may suffer from allergies and must seek medical care. 
You should contact the emergency department of your nearest hospital if you suffer from an anaphylactic attack.

The best way to manage latex allergy is to avoid it, as continued exposure can worsen the condition. 


Treatment varies depending upon the reaction – a mild sensitivity or a life-threatening allergic reaction.


The first step in irritant dermatitis is to remove latex and clean the affected area.


Immediate monitoring and treatment for life-threatening conditions is needed for severe allergic reactions.


 
1. Medications
These may be taken after exposure to latex to control your reaction and help relieve discomfort. The common medications used to treat symptoms associated with latex allergy include:


Antihistamines: These medications inhibit the release of histamine, a key mediator involved in allergic reactions. They are used to control most of the symptoms, such as hives, itching, runny nose, and sneezing, that are predominantly associated with latex allergy. Examples include diphenhydramine and cetirizine.




Topical steroids: Topical steroids are used to reduce inflammation. Hydrocortisone is a commonly used medication. 




Injectable: Adrenaline is the first-line treatment for severe reactions. 




Anti-IgE therapy: Type 1 latex allergy is associated with an increase in the level of IgE, which triggers a cascade of events that cause symptoms. Omalizumab has been found to significantly reduce the symptoms by decreasing the level of IgE.

2. Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy is used for severe allergies or allergies that do not respond to standard medication. This involves a series of allergen exposures via injections or tablets over a few years. With time, this helps desensitize the body’s immune system to the allergen and prevents severe allergic reactions.","Complications Of Latex Allergy
 
Individuals who are more frequently exposed to latex or have a very high sensitization to latex are more likely to develop anaphylaxis. 
Anaphylactic shock is a severe condition that can block your airways and prevent you from breathing. This is due to the decrease in blood pressure that prevents the heart from receiving enough oxygen. The complications of anaphylaxis include:


Reduced oxygen supply to the brain


Acute kidney failure


Septic shock


Collection of fluid in the air sacs of the lungs


Arrhythmias


Abnormal liver function

1. Take precautions while using gloves
Gloves are the primary source of allergens. The following measures should be taken to prevent the allergy to latex gloves:


Non-latex gloves should be used for everyday activities such as food preparation, routine housekeeping, and general maintenance, as they are not likely to be in contact with infectious materials.


Use powder-free latex gloves when appropriate barrier protection is necessary, such as while caring for a person with an infectious disease.


2. Avoid the use of latex products
People who have experienced a trigger in the past should avoid products made from natural rubber, such as balloons, condoms, and shoe soles. They should also read the labels before using any product that they think might contain latex. 
3. Follow safe practices
Individuals with latex allergy should follow appropriate work practices to reduce the development of symptoms. These measures include:


Avoid using oil-based hand creams while wearing gloves, as they can deteriorate the gloves


Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after removing gloves


Clean areas and equipment contaminated with latex-containing dust frequently


4. Recognize the symptoms 
Recognizing latex allergy symptoms, including skin rashes, hives, flushing, itching, nasal, eye, or sinus symptoms, and asthma is essential. This helps prevent a more severe reaction and a possible trigger. 
5. Wear medical identification
People who have experienced allergic symptoms to latex in the past should wear a bracelet or necklace depicting their latex allergy. This helps prevent exposure through another person, especially while traveling and at the workplace. 
6. Carry emergency essentials
A person with a latex allergy can experience episodes of anaphylaxis at any time, which can be fatal. So, individuals should carry auto-injectable epinephrine and sterile, non-latex gloves for emergency use. It is also advisable to carry allergy medications, such as antihistamines, asthma medications, and inhalers.

","Causes Of Leprosy

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium Leprae complex, which comprises M. leprae and M. lepromatosis. Leprosy is also called Hansen's disease, named after the scientist who discovered M. leprae in 1873.Lab tests show that M. leprae grow optimally at temperatures ranging from 27 to 33 C. This explains its predilection for cooler regions of the body like skin, nerves close to the surface of skin, eyes and thin tissue lining the nose. It divides very slowly and takes years to reach a number sufficient to show any signs of infection. The mode of transmission is not entirely understood. It is thought that disease transmission happens when a person actively suffering from the disease sneezes or coughs and releases the bacteria into the atmosphere and a healthy person breathes in the droplets. However, it is not easily transmissible or highly contagious. Prolonged close contact with a person actively suffering from this disease is essential for disease transmission. Majority of people have a natural immunity to the disease and will not develop any symptoms even if they are exposed to it. Only about 5 percent of all people are susceptible to the disease. ","Types Of Leprosy

In order to make the diagnosis simple and ensure prompt and quick treatment of leprosy, WHO (World Health Organization) has classified it into 2 types - multibacillary leprosy and paucibacillary leprosy.


Paucibacillary leprosy is when a person has around 1 to 5 skin lesions and no bacteria are detected in the skin samples. It is the least contagious form and can be further classified into tuberculoid (T.T.) and borderline tuberculoid (B.T.)


Multibacillary leprosy is when a person has more than 5 skin lesions and bacteria are detected in the skin smear, or both. It is the most contagious form and can be further classified into borderline (B.B), borderline lepromatous (B.L.) and lepromatous (L.L.).


 Note: In tuberculoid leprosy (TT), the infection is localized and the patients are resistant to the bacillus whereas in lepromatous leprosy (LL) the infection is disseminated and the patients  are extremely sensitive to the bacillus. The other borderline forms (BT, BB, BL) fall in between the two ends of the spectrum (TT and LL).",,"Prevention Of Leprosy

Leprosy can be transmitted only via prolonged and close contact with an active infected case. It is possible to prevent the transmission of leprosy by reducing close contact with the infected person. However, it is essential to note that leprosy cannot spread by a mere handshake, and discrimination against leprosy patients is strongly discouraged.There is no commercially available vaccine available to prevent leprosy. However, the BCG vaccine which is used to prevent TB, provides some protection against leprosy but is not often used for that purpose.Certain animals like  nine-banded armadillos, African chimpanzee, sooty mangabey, and cynomolgus macaque can rarely transfer M. leprae to humans. It is advisable not to handle such animals in the wild. If someone is extensively exposed to the bacteria, they may be started on prophylactic medicines to prevent the occurrence of the disease. Using Rifampicin reduces the development of paucibacillary leprosy by almost 50%.","Treatment Of Leprosy

As leprosy is a bacterial disease, it is treated with a combination of antibiotics for a period of 6 months or 12 months depending upon the type of leprosy and can be extended as per individual case. As per the WHO guidelines, a 3-drug regimen of rifampicin, dapsone and clofazimine is recommended for all patients, with a treatment duration of 6 months for paucibacillary leprosy(PB) and 12 months for multibacillary leprosy (MB). This therapy helps to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance by the bacteria, which may further increase the course of treatment. The condition can be cured if the treatment is followed and completed as recommended by the doctor.Antibiotics used to treat leprosy act by killing the bacteria, and hence, can cure the disease and prevent it from getting worse. However, it does not reverse the nerve damage or any physical deformation that has occurred prior to the diagnosis of the condition. Hence, it is extremely important to diagnose the condition at the earliest to prevent permanent nerve damage. 

1. Antibiotics

Depending on the type and severity of leprosy( PB and MB) a combination of the following drugs is given for 6 or 12 months:


Clofazimine 


Rifampicin 


Dapsone


2. Nerve tonics (neurotonics)
Nerve tonics can help ease symptoms caused by nerve damage. However, the damage to the nerve is permanent.

3. Treatment of resistant cases

In cases which are resistant to one or two of above first line drugs, treatment can be extended to 24 months and following other drugs can be included in the multi drug therapy:




Clarithromycin


Minocycline


Ofloxacin


Moxifloxacin


Levofloxacin



","Home Care For Leprosy

The aim of leprosy care at home is to minimize the occurrence of serious complications of the disease. You can do the following things at home:


Protect your eyes from dust, harsh sunlight, and dryness. Clean your eyes gently with a clean cloth every day. Look in the mirror to check for the appearance of any changes in the eyes.


Protect your hands and feet from injuries, and check for any undetected injuries every day. If there is a loss of sensation in the hands or feet, take extra care to prevent burns and injuries.


Clean your hands and feet daily with lukewarm water. Soak hands/feet in lukewarm water and scrape away the hardened skin. Apply an emollient cream to your hands and feet to prevent dryness.


Perform finger and toe exercises daily to prevent stiffness and loss of mobility of the digits.

","Complications Of Leprosy

The complications of leprosy depend on how quickly the condition is diagnosed and effectively treated. Very few complications occur if physicians treat the disease early enough, but the following is a list of complications that can occur when diagnosis and treatment is either delayed or started late in the disease process:


Wounds and ulceration in the hands or feet


Permanent damage to the nerves of extremities


Progressive deformities in the fingers, toes and nose


Chronic nasal congestion, nosebleeds, and collapse of the nasal septum


Glaucoma which is an eye condition that damages the optic nerve


Uveitis or inflammation of eye


Blindness


Erectile dysfunction


Infertility


Kidney failure

Leprosy is known as Kustha Roga in Ayurveda. There are several treatments in Ayurveda for leprosy, which include medicines for oral consumption, such as the compounds of Triphala, Khadira, Guduchi, Pippali, etc., or paste for topical application made from sulfur, mustard oil, turmeric, etc.

Physiotherapy

Physiotherapy exercises help maintain the function and mobility of the affected digits. It also helps prevent deformities, such as claw hand. It can also help improve the function of an already deformed hand.","Living With Leprosy

Leprosy patients need to be extra careful when taking care of their health as they are at an increased risk of getting injuries or burns due to reduced sensations. This necessitates special care for the extremities. Patients must be careful to wear gloves while holding hot utensils or other hot objects, and prompt medical care is essential even for minor cuts and injuries. Early treatment is the key to a successful outcome in leprosy.Patients suffering from leprosy often have to battle social stigma and discrimination due to the misconceptions still prevalent about the disease. Due to this stigma most people do not seek medical help when the symptoms start to appear, which in turn delays the diagnosis as well as the treatment and increases the risk of disabilities.Moreover, girls and women with leprosy have to face added social as well as gender discrimination which further affects the diagnosis and treatment. In some cases, this stigma can also interfere with the day-to-day life of the patient. Hence, it is very important to give due importance to mental health. Do not be apprehensive to consult a counselor or therapist. Sometimes sharing your feelings can help you deal with them better. It might be good to talk to someone who is going through exactly the same feelings as yours.

Note: The time between a person’s exposure to a contaminated source and becoming sick is 2 days to 4 weeks. The illness can last from a few days to 3 weeks or longer.
Phases of Leptospirosis 
Leptospirosis usually presents in the following phases:
1. Anicteric syndrome 
It is the most common form which is not very severe and shows symptoms similar to the flu. It starts suddenly and can cause a headache, cough, rash that doesn't itch, fever, shivering, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and diarrhea.
2. Immune phase
It refers to the progression of the disease where the body's immune system responds to the infection caused by the Leptospira bacteria. The anicteric syndrome can also have recurrence several days later, and this phase is called the immune stage. During this stage, aseptic meningitis (it is inflammation of the brain meninges that have negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bacterial cultures) can occur. 
3. Icteric phase
Also known as Weil's disease, it is a very serious infection that can last for several months and can cause a range of symptoms such as high fever, kidney failure, jaundice, bleeding in the lungs, and respiratory distress.","Causes Of Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis is caused by a bacteria called leptospira, which is found in the urine of infected animals. Animals like rodents, cattle, buffaloes, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs are considered common reservoirs of this bacteria. 
The bacteria can survive for weeks to months in urine-contaminated water and soil.
The common modes by which people can get infected include:


Direct contact with infected animals or their urine, reproductive fluids, or body tissues


Contact with urine-contaminated water from floods, rivers, streams, and sewage (especially during high rain or monsoon season that causes the spreading of bacteria)


Contact with urine-contaminated wet soil


Intake of food or water contaminated by urine or urine containing water



Transmission occurs through mucous membranes, conjunctiva, and nonintact skin like skin cuts or abrasions. The incubation period is usually 5–14 days, with a range of 2–30 days. 

Know how to monsoon-proof your health.Read now","Risk Factors Of Leptospirosis
Understanding the risk factors of leptospirosis is crucial for preventing this bacterial infection. They include:
1. Occupation
Direct contact with animals and activities that can lead to skin abrasions and water or soil exposure, such as clearing brush, trekking, and gardening are associated with a high risk of leptospirosis. The occupations which are more susceptible include:


Sewage workers


Butchers


Farmers


Veterinarians


Hunters


Fish workers


Dairy farmers


Military personnel


2. Outdoor activities
Swimming, rafting, kayaking, wading, or boating in flood water or freshwater (rivers, streams, lakes) that may be contaminated with animal urine increase the risk of leptospirosis.
Prolonged immersion or submerging head, or swallowing contaminated water can particularly increase risk. 
3. Household exposure 
Potentially contaminated sources like pet dogs, domesticated livestock, rainwater catchment systems, and infestation by infected rodents can increase the risk of leptospirosis.
4. Low socioeconomic status
Living in overcrowded urban areas with poor sanitation is also a known risk factor for getting infected with this infection.
5. Travel to endemic areas 
Travel to areas with heavy rainfall or flooding can also lead to leptospirosis.
6. Mother-to-child transmission
An infected mother can transmit the infection to her baby during pregnancy or childbirth. It is important to seek medical care and take preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission and protect both the mother and the baby.
 
Did you know? 
Leptospirosis in pregnancy may be misdiagnosed as it can mimic other pregnancy-associated conditions, including infections, pregnancy-associated hypertension, acute fatty liver, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome). ","Prevention Of Leptospirosis 
Although human vaccines have been used in some countries with varying degrees of success, there are no WHO-prequalified vaccines currently available. The measures to prevent transmission of leptospirosis include the following:
Avoid exposure


Avoid walking, swimming, bathing, swallowing, or submerging head in potentially contaminated water bodies especially during monsoons, periods of heavy rainfall or flooding. 


Cover open wounds with waterproof dressings. 


Ensure safe drinking water 


Drink only filtered or boiled water


Use filtered or boiled water to prepare food, brush teeth, and make ice


Avoid using water bottles without a seal


Store water in a clean and covered container


Cook and consume food vigilantly


Prepare food in filtered or boiled water


Wash fruits and vegetables with filtered or boiled water


Consume fruits and vegetables after peeling


Use of PPE (Personal protective equipment)


Animal handlers should treat all animals as if they are infected and wear full protection (waterproof coveralls/ clothing, gloves) at all times.


Wear full-cover, waterproof boots or shoes that do not allow water to enter from the top.


Farm, agricultural and horticultural workers should treat all wet soil and vegetation as if it is contaminated and wear full protection, particularly after heavy rain. 


Chemoprophylaxis


Administration of doxycycline 200 mg, once a week, during the peak transmission season may be given to agricultural workers or high-risk individuals.


Rodent control
Rats are the main reservoirs for leptospirosis bacterium in India. Hence controlling these reservoir species with proper strategy planning and management planning will reduce the incidence of the disease. It includes:


Determining the host species responsible for the infection in the affected region


Defining specific areas for implementing rodent control measures


Conducting necessary activities before the onset of the monsoon season


Utilizing suitable technology for effective rodent control, ensuring accurate inputs and proper application methods.


Establishing a proper drainage system


The mapping of water bodies and human activities in water-logged areas should be


carried out. Farmers should be educated to drain out the urine from the cattle shed into a pit, instead of letting it flow and mix with rivers, ponds etc.
Tips to protect your pets


Keep your pets out of contaminated water, especially after heavy rainfall or flooding


Keep your pets away from other animal’s urine


Make sure your pets only drink clean filtered or boiled water


Keep your pets away from rodents, and wild animals


Vaccinate livestock and dogs. Vaccines are available for cattle, dogs, and pigs that provide short-term protection. 


Install suitable fencing that separates livestock from access to potentially contaminated bodies of water (e.g. valley dams, rivers, ponds) and surrounding areas.

Liver cancer can be categorized into primary and secondary types.
1. Primary liver cancer
Primary liver cancer is the most common type of liver cancer. It originates in the cells called hepatocytes, which are responsible for carrying out various functions of the liver.Different subtypes of primary liver cancer based on their cellular characteristics are:


Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): This subtype accounts for the majority of all primary liver cancers. HCC often develops in individuals with underlying chronic liver diseases.





Fibrolamellar Carcinoma: This rare subtype typically affects younger individuals who do not have any underlying chronic liver disease. It has distinct features under a microscope and may have a better prognosis compared to other forms of primary liver cancer.





Cholangiocarcinoma: Unlike HCC which starts in hepatocytes, cholangiocarcinoma arises from bile duct cells within or outside the liver. It occurs less frequently than HCC but can be more challenging to treat due to its location and tendency to spread early on.



2. Secondary liver cancer
This occurs when cancer spreads from another part of the body (such as breast, lung, colon) to the liver via blood circulation or direct invasion into adjacent organs like pancreas or stomach.Give your liver the attention and care it deserves to safeguard it from diseases.Explore Liver Care Range","Causes Of Liver Cancer
 
The development of liver cancer is a complex process involving the liver cells. Here's an overview of what happens during liver cancer:



DNA, the genetic material, governs cell behavior, growth, division, and cell death.




Multiple mutations in DNA that activate cell division or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and abnormal mass formation in the liver.




Over time, these abnormal cells may spread within the liver or to other organs through the bloodstream or lymphatic system.

","Diagnosis Of Liver Cancer
 
To arrive at the diagnosis and chart the treatment course of cancer, it is important to understand its staging. The most common way of staging liver cancer is the TNM staging system, where:



T: Tumor and how many layers of the liver wall the tumor has penetrated




N: Lymph Nodes and how many lymph nodes have cancer spread to. It also looks at where the lymph nodes are affected and how close to the original tumor.




M: Metastasis ie. spread to other parts of the body



Depending on this the cancer is divided into 4 stages. These are:
1. Stage 0: Also known as carcinoma in situ. This stage is distinguished by abnormal cells in the liver lining. The cells can become malignant in the future.2. Stage I: Cancer is localized to the liver and has not spread to nearby blood vessels or lymph nodes.3. Stage II: Cancer has either grown larger and/or has invaded nearby blood vessels but has not spread to distant sites or lymph nodes.4. Stage III: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or structures beyond the liver, but it has not spread to distant organs.5. Stage IV: Cancer has spread to distant organs or structures, indicating advanced metastatic disease.

The diagnosis consists of the following:
1. Medical history and physical examination
Your doctor will begin by taking a detailed medical history, including any risk factors for liver cancer, your medications, lifestyle habits, previous surgeries, or any other health conditions. A physical examination may reveal signs such as an enlarged liver and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)
2. Blood tests
These tests are part of a comprehensive diagnostic approach, often combined with other imaging and biopsy procedures. The doctor can assess the overall health with liver and kidney function tests and detect any abnormalities with blood cell counts. High levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and other tumor markers may also indicate liver cancer.

3. Imaging studies
Imaging tests are crucial for evaluating the liver and identifying any tumors. Common imaging studies include:


Ultrasound: A non-invasive test using sound waves to create an image of the liver.


CT (Computed Tomography) scan: X-ray images taken from different angles to create detailed cross-sectional images of the liver.


MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): This imaging technique uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses, and a computer to produce detailed pictures of the liver and surroundings.




PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan: Helps determine the extent of the disease and if it has spread to other parts of the body.




Angiography: It is a method to visualize blood vessels, but isn't very effective in spotting small HCC tumors. It's mostly used for mapping the liver's structure before surgery or guiding chemoembolization treatment.


4. Liver biopsy
If a suspicious mass or tumor is detected, a liver biopsy may be performed to obtain a small tissue sample for analysis under a microscope. This helps confirm the presence of cancer cells and determine the type and stage of the cancer.

5. Laparoscopy
Also known as keyhole surgery, is a minimally invasive procedure where a small tube with a camera and light (laparoscope) is inserted through a small abdominal cut. This helps assess the liver and surrounding areas, aiding in determining if surgery to remove cancer is feasible. ","Doctor To Visit
Management of liver cancer takes a comprehensive approach that involves multiple specialists. 
A general practitioner can evaluate causes of liver abnormalities and refer to the following specialists for assessment:

Gastroenterologist

If you are experiencing any liver symptoms or have risk factors that can increase your chances of liver cancer, seek professional guidance.Talk To An Expert","Home-care For Liver Cancer

Liver cancer requires a conventional medical treatment approach. However, some home-remedies are believed to support liver health and augment the medical treatment.

1. Milk thistle: It is a Mediterranean herb which acts as a powerful liver cleanser by rebuilding liver cells, reducing liver damage, and removing toxins from the body that are processed through the liver. However, consult your doctor before using it to ensure it is safe and appropriate for you.Tip: It can be consumed in the form of a capsule as directed by your doctor or brew milk thistle tea from seeds with hot water under professional guidance.

2. Turmeric (Haldi): It inhibits the growth of liver cancer, reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, and demonstrates anti-tumour activity.
Tip: Add a tablespoon of turmeric in hot milk with honey and drink this once a day for about a month.Buy turmeric products online.

3. Ginger (Adrak): It can suppress metastasis of liver cancer, stop the rapid increase of cancer cells and inhibit inflammation.
Tip: You can include ginger in your diet by using it in cooking, making ginger tea, or adding it to smoothies.Want to know more benefits of ginger?Click here
 
4. Garlic (Lehsun): It inhibits the growth of precancerous lesions in the liver and migration of cancer cells.Tip: It can be used by adding crushed or minced garlic to various dishes such as salads, soups, stir-fries, or as a seasoning in cooking.

5. Cinnamon (Dalchini): It increases the production of ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) which can play a role in killing cancer cells.Tip: Incorporate cinnamon by sprinkling it on foods like oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies, or in tea for potential flavor and health benefits.","Complications Of Liver Cancer
 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer, can cause significant complications that include:1. Liver failure: Liver cancer can impair the normal functioning of the liver, leading to liver failure that can be life-threatening.2. Hepatic encephalopathy: It is a condition where the liver's inability to remove toxins like ammonia from the blood affects brain function. It can lead to confusion, difficulty concentrating, and changes in mental status.3. Portal vein thrombosis: This complication involves the formation of blood clots in the portal vein, a major blood vessel in the liver. 4. Worsening ascites: Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. In HCC, ascites can worsen, causing abdominal swelling and discomfort due to the liver's impaired ability to manage fluid levels.5. Variceal bleeding: Liver cancer can cause increased pressure in the portal vein, a major blood vessel in the liver. This can result in portal hypertension, leading to symptoms like abdominal swelling, varices (enlarged veins), and increased risk of bleeding in the digestive tract.6. Obstructive jaundice: Liver cancer can obstruct the bile ducts, causing a buildup of bilirubin in the body. 7. Pyogenic liver abscess: Liver cancer can predispose individuals to infections within the liver, resulting in the formation of pus-filled pockets (abscesses). 8. Metastasis: Liver cancer can spread (metastasize) to other organs or parts of the body, leading to additional complications associated with secondary tumors in those areas.Learn about some tips to prevent liver diseases.Read along","Alternative Therapies For Liver Cancer

","Symptoms Of Malaria
Malaria is an acute febrile illness which can cause a wide variety of symptoms that range from no symptoms in the early course of infection to severe symptoms and even death. After a bite by the infected Anopheles mosquito, it usually takes around a week to a month for the first symptom to appear. This period is known as the incubation period. The incubation period for an infection with P.falciparum (a type of malarial parasite, Plasmodium) is shorter as compared to the one with P.malariae (another malarial parasite).The symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache, and chills – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness, often leading to death. Some people with malaria experience cycles of malaria ""attacks”, which usually starts with shivering and chills, followed by a high fever and sweating before it returns to normal temperature.The attacks (malarial paroxysm) occur in three stages:

 Cold stage -- sudden feeling of cold and shivering
 Hot stage -- high fever
 Sweating stage --stage before the temperature returns to normal

Other symptoms include:

 Headache

 Nausea and vomiting
 Body pain especially in the muscles and joints
 Loss of appetite

In severe cases, symptoms that may occur include:

Anemia
Bleeding
Jaundice
Convulsions
",,"Causes Of Malaria

Malaria is caused due to a bite by a female anopheles mosquito infected by the Plasmodium parasite. The bite transfers the parasite (sporozoites) into the blood which travels to the liver. In the liver, the parasites mature and multiply to form merozoites. This is followed by an invasion of the red blood cells that causes malaria.
Since the malaria parasite is found in red blood cells of an infected person, it can also be transmitted rarely through blood transfusions, organ transplant or by shared use of contaminated syringes or needles. Other mode of transmission can be from infected mother to child during pregnancy or labour.
In humans, malaria is caused by five different species of the parasite. These are P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi. Among these, P. falciparum is the most common one (~75%) followed by P. vivax (~20%).
In India, malaria is mainly caused by P. vivax and P. falciparum. Malaria due to P. vivax is more prevalent in plain areas, while P. falciparum is responsible for most of the malaria cases in hilly areas and those covered with forests.",,,,"Specialist To Visit

See a doctor if you have a high fever with chills and have mosquitoes breeding around your home. Also, if you experience a combination of symptoms such as sweats, headaches, body aches, weakness, nausea, and vomiting along with fever and chills, then do not think twice before visiting a doctor. Experts that can help you to diagnose and treat malaria include:

","Treatment Of Malaria

The medicines prescribed depend on various factors such as the species of malarial parasite and the severity of the disease. Often the doctor prescribes a combination of drugs.
 
In most cases, the treatment for malaria includes administration of the medicine Chloroquine. For the severe form of disease IV Quinine or Quinidine may be given. Primaquine is used to kill dormant liver forms of P. vivax and P. ovale. Recently, chloroquine resistance has been seen in P. falciparum from some areas. 
 
For chloroquine resistant malaria, Mefloquine, Halofantrine and Lumefantrine can be used along with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). ACT is a combination of two or more drugs that work against the malaria parasite in different ways. Examples are artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) and artesunate-mefloquine. 
 
Other drugs that may be prescribed include atovaquone-proguanil combinations, quinine sulfate combinations, primaquine phosphate, doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin. Also, drugs like paracetamol are prescribed to provide relief from pain, fever and body aches, which are commonly seen in people with malaria.
Here is a complete list of medications for malaria you may want to know.Click To Read!","Home Care For Malaria

Try the following home remedies to bring down fever and treat other symptoms of malaria:
 
1. Boil some basil leaves along with black pepper (kalimirch) in 2 glasses of water until reduced to half. Drink this decoction whenever you have a fever.
2. Drink neem tea after meals to treat malaria. Boil a few neem leaves in water and use this decoction as tea.
3. Eat grapefruit or drink its juice to combat the malaria parasite.  
4. Take half an inch of cinnamon (dalchini) stick and grind it. Boil in water. Drink it with honey and a pinch of black pepper.
5. Eat citrus fruits such as orange, lime, and lemon to boost immunity and speed up recovery. Diet for malaria
In addition to taking medicines and using home remedies to treat malaria, eating a healthy and balanced diet can play a key role in improving your condition and fasten your recovery. During the active disease
A diet consisting of juices and very light foods like rice, dal, vegetables with minimal fat content is highly recommended. Fresh seasonal fruits and fresh juices such as mangoes, apples, grapes, grapefruits papaya, and pineapple should also be given.During the recovery period
A diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, paneer, whole grains and nuts is advised. Tulsi is a natural anti-malarial and a few leaves boiled in water may be given daily along with the allopathic medicines.After recovery
As there are high chances that a person might feel weak even after he/she is recovered from malaria. This is why a diet rich in protein is recommended to help the body repair the damage the infection has dealt. Cereals, pulses, nuts and meats are a great source of protein. Dark leafy green vegetables that are rich in iron, rice and whole grains should be consumed to help patients get back to normal health. ","Complications Of Malaria

Malaria is a serious condition which if left unattended may lead to death. Although malaria can be a deadly disease, illness and death from malaria can usually be prevented with proper diagnosis, timely treatment and care.If left untreated, it can cause severe organ failure and other health complications like:


Cerebral malaria that causes neurological abnormalities


Severe anemia due to destruction of the red blood cells


Blood in the urine or stools


Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which causes a severe inflammatory reaction in the lungs


Abnormalities in blood coagulation

","Symptoms Of Male infertility

Male infertility is the inability to conceive a child after 1 year of regular intercourse without any birth control. Infertility by itself is a symptom. Various signs and symptoms that may be associated with male infertility include:



Difficulty with ejaculation or small volumes of fluid ejaculated


Reduced sexual desire


Erectile dysfunction (difficulty maintaining an erection)


Pain, swelling, or a lump in the testicle area


Gynecomastia (abnormal fullness in breasts)


Hormonal abnormality (decreased facial or body hair)


Recurrent respiratory tract infections


Inability to smell


Reduced body mass


Obesity

Male infertility is mainly caused due to anatomical abnormalities and ejaculatory disorders. Causes can be broadly classified into the following:
1. Pre-testicular causes


Quality and quantity of semen: Over 90% of cases of male infertility are related directly to sperm numbers or poor sperm quality.




Hormonal deficiency/imbalance: Male sex hormones exhibit a significant and focal role in the growth, improvement, and proliferation of testicles. eg. isolated LH and FSH deficiencies are linked to infertility.




Genetics: A few chromosomal defects are directly related to male infertility. Examples include myotonic dystrophy, microdeletion, and Kallmann's syndrome amongst others.




Oxidative stress: It is a phenomenon caused by an imbalance between the production and accumulation of oxygen reactive species (ROS) in cells. It can cause sperm dysfunction leading to infertility in men.




Pituitary diseases: The pituitary is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of your brain. Disorders like pituitary insufficiency, hyperprolactinemia, exogenous hormones, and growth hormone deficiency can cause infertility in men.


2. Testicular causes


Orchiectomy: It refers to the surgical removal of both testes.




Primitive testicular dysfunction: This may result from testosterone deficiency or impaired sperm production leading to male infertility.




Cryptorchidism: It is a condition in which one or both of the testes fail to descend from the stomach into the scrotum (a bag of skin that holds and helps to protect the testicles).




Atrophic testes: Small or shrunk testicles.




Varicoceles: These are enlarged veins on the scrotum that are associated with male infertility.




Epididymitis: It is swelling or pain in the back of the testicle caused due to sexually transmitted infections.




Malignancies: Testicular tumors or adrenal tumors leading to an excess of androgens, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy can lead to male infertility. 




Chromosomal disorders: Disorders like Klinefelter’s syndrome and XYY male affect the testicles and can lead to infertility.




Sertoli- cell-only syndrome: Also known as del Castillo syndrome or germ cell aplasia, is one of the most common causes of the absence of sperm in infertile men. This syndrome affects sperm production in men.


3. Post-testicular causes


Ejaculatory duct obstruction: It is a pathological condition that is characterized by the obstruction of one or both ejaculatory ducts. It can be present at birth or acquired later in life.


Cystic fibrosis: It is a congenital condition that affects the lungs, heart, and other organs. Most men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because of an absence of the sperm canal, known as the congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD).


Antisperm antibodies: These are antibodies that work against the sperms. They can severely impact sperm quality, sperm count, and sperm motility. 

",,"Diagnosis Of Male infertility

Diagnosing the exact cause of infertility is important in determining the course of treatment. Most of the time, there is more than one cause of infertility. Here are a few tests the doctors at fertility clinics may conduct. They include:
1. Medical history
This consists of taking a detailed reproductive history, medical history, any history of past surgeries, and if the individual is on any medications.
2. Physical examination
This consists of examining the following:


General appearance: It consists of seeing the hair distribution, and body habitus.


Abdominal examination: During this examination, the abdomen is examined for any hernias or surgical scars.


Genital examination: This examination is done in both standing and supine positions. It is done by palpating the testes, epididymis, vasa deferentia, spermatic cord, and phallus.


Digital rectal examination: This is done in men who are over 40 years of age. Presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or low sperm volume.


3. Semen testing


Semen analysis: Semen samples are sent to laboratories to measure the number, motility, and shape of the sperms present. In most cases, doctors conduct several tests to ensure accuracy.




Semen DNA fragmentation: This test is done to evaluate lifestyle risk factors, recurrent miscarriages, and failure of IVF and IUF treatments.




Seminal oxidative stress measures: This test is indicated in unexplained infertility, to detect varicocele, a history of genitourinary infection, and to evaluate lifestyle risk factors.


4. Blood tests


Hormone testing: Hormones produced by the pituitary glands, hypothalamus, and testicles can affect fertility significantly. Doctors will take a blood test to measure the level of the following hormones:


Testosterone


Luteinizing hormone (LH) 


Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)


Prolactin


Estradiol






Immunobead test (IBT): This test is designed to look for the presence of antibodies (IgA) in motile sperm.


5. Genetic screening


Sperm chromatin and abnormal DNA assays: This is a new diagnostic tool that can detect sperm samples that have a high degree of DNA fragmentation.




Chromosome and genetic studies: This test evaluates male factors that detect signs of genetic abnormalities affecting the Y chromosome (unique to only men).


6. Testicular biopsy
It is a procedure in which a small portion of the testicle is removed for examination. The sample is then viewed under the microscope to check for any abnormalities. Bilateral testicular biopsy (TBO) is recommended while diagnosing male infertility. It is predominantly useful for the investigation of decreased or absence of sperms.
7. Imaging tests


Ultrasound: Doctors may conduct scrotal or transrectal ultrasounds to see if there is any problem with the testicles or prostate gland that can affect fertility. In a scrotal ultrasound, the doctor will see if there are any problems in the testicles. In the rectal one, they will insert a lubed wand into your rectum to check your prostate for blockages.


Doppler blood flow: This test is done to check for any inflammation, swelling, or torsion of testicles in the case of varicocele.




MRI pituitary: Indicated to detect true prolactinoma (noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland that produces a hormone called prolactin).




MRI pelvis/scrotum: This test is done to check for undescended testes and suspicious testicular lesions.




Vasography: It is mainly done to rule out any kind of obstructions, especially before surgery.

","Symptoms Of Measles
The first symptoms of measles develop 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus. It includes cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and fever. Measles rashe appear 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms. 

1. Initial symptoms 

The first symptoms develop after 7 to 14 days of infection. It begins with a high temperature that reaches around 104°F. The other symptoms include cough, runny nose, swollen eyelids, weakness, loss of appetite, watery eyes, and red eyes that may be sensitive to light.

2. Koplik spots 

A day or two before the rashes appear Koplik spots may appear inside the mouth (small grayish-white spots). These spots usually last for a few days and not everyone develops these spots.

3. Measles rash

A measles rash appears 2 weeks after the initial symptoms. The symptoms become severe and signals towards the host’s immune response towards the replicating virus. It usually begins as red spots. The rash is made up of small, red, brown spots that may join together into large blotchy patches. It first appears on the neck or head before spreading to the rest of the body. The rash fades slowly in the same order of progression as it appeared. Resolution of rash may be followed by desquamation (shedding of outer layer of skin), particularly in undernourished children.As the rash of measles is a consequence of immune response, it may be absent in immunocompromised individuals.

4. Other symptoms

Other symptoms like headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgia may be present.",,"Causes Of Measles
Measles is caused by an extremely contagious virus called morbillivirus, a member of the paramyxoviridae family. It is spread by:


Contaminated droplets that are transmitted through the air while coughing, sneezing, talking or coming in direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. The virus remains contagious in the air for up to two hours.


Sharing food, drinks and utensils with someone who has measles.


Kissing someone with measles.


Shaking hands or hugging someone with someone who has measles.


Pregnant women to their babies during the pregnancy, delivery or while breastfeeding.


It can take one to three weeks to show symptoms of measles after being infected. This is the incubation period. This period may be shorter in infants and longer in adults.Note: One is contagious about four days before developing a rash to about four days after the rash appears.","Risk Factors Of Measles
While measles can affect anyone, some risk factors elevate the risk of contracting the disease. Some of the risk factors are:

1. Vitamin A deficiency

Measles is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. If you have Vitamin A deficiency, there is a very high chance of measles infection. 

2. Being unvaccinated

Unvaccinated young children are prone to measles and its complications including death. Unvaccinated pregnant women and non-immune people can become infected. 
3. International traveling 
Traveling to countries where measles is common and less controlled puts you at a higher risk of developing the disease. 

4. Countries experiencing a measles outbreak 

Countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster. Damage to health infrastructures interrupts routine immunization and greatly increases the risk of infection. Here are 10 things you should follow if your child has a fever.Click To Read!","Specialist To Visit
Patients exhibiting the signs and symptoms of measles should visit first to a general physician. The doctor will be able to diagnose measles from the combination of the symptoms especially with the characteristics of rashes and if the condition worsens many complications can also be seen.

There is no specific treatment for measles and the condition usually improves by itself within 7 to 10 days. To avoid the spreading of infection avoid contact with people who are vulnerable like pregnant women, immunocompromised people, and young children. Also try to stay away from work or school at least for 4 days when the measles rash first appears. The treatment includes relieving the symptoms & fighting the infection. If symptoms are causing discomfort then the symptoms need to be treated first, while you wait for your body to fight off the virus. The treatment approach includes:

1. Controlling fever and relieving pain



Paracetamol and Ibuprofen can be taken to control fever and the pain caused by the fever. 


Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children.


2. Taking Vitamin A supplements
Children with low levels of Vitamin A are more likely to show more severe symptoms of measles. Vitamin A has been found to be effective in reducing the severity of measles. The WHO recommends administration of once daily doses of 200,000 IU of Vitamin A for 2 consecutive days to all children with measles who are >12 months of age and lower doses for children 6-12 months of age.

3. Drinking plenty of fluids 

If your child is having a high temperature drink a lot of fluids to eliminate the risk of dehydration. 

4. Treating sore eyes 

Cleaning your child’s eyelids and closing curtains or dimming lights can help in soothing the eyes.

5. Treating cold-like symptoms 

If your child has cold-like symptoms that make them sit in a hot bathroom, drinking warm drinks containing honey can help to relax the airway and soothe a cough. 

6. Dealing with other illnesses

Medical care is necessary to avoid serious complications because of the measles virus. Some serious problems are:


Shortness of breath


Convulsions 


Sharp chest pain 


7. Ribavirin (antiviral)
Some case reports have been published in favor of intravenous ribavirin in immunocompromised patients. However, the benefits of ribavirin in measles have not been conclusively demonstrated in trials.","Home-care For Measles
There is no specific home care treatment for measles. The patient requires care and time to time medicines and few precautions since it is a contagious disease. Home care is to be taken to make the disease tolerable:

","Symptoms Of Melanoma
Several symptoms can indicate the presence of melanoma in your body. However, few common symptoms of melanoma can overlap with those of several skin cancer types. Nevertheless, several symptoms are specific to melanoma. Melanoma can start developing in any part of your body. But it is most commonly seen in the areas, which are exposed to the sun. These body parts include the face, legs, arms, and back. People who have a darker skin shade can also have melanoma developing in areas with less sun exposure. These body parts include the palms of your hand, the fingernail beds, and the soles of your feet. These are known as hidden melanomas. Some of the earliest symptoms of melanoma can be:


A change or development in a pre-existing mole


A new mole, pigmented skin, or growth starts developing on your skin


However, it is important to note that melanoma doesn’t always start from a mole. There are some easy ways to differentiate between a normal mole and a mole that can become carcinogenic. To remember this, all you need to think of are the letters ABCDE:


‘A’ stands for asymmetry: A mole that has a chance of becoming cancerous will most likely have an asymmetrical shape. Therefore, the mole will not have identical halves and will look like it has no particular shape.




‘B’ stands for border: In a cancerous mole, the border will be irregular. It will not be circular or oval, like normal moles. Instead, it might have a notched or scalloped border.




‘C’ stands for color: Carcinogenic moles can change colors with time. Try looking for unusual growths that have different colors instead of one particular color. Some of these moles might have a single color, but they might be unevenly distributed, which can also be an indication.




‘D’ stands for diameter: Usually, moles are about ¼ inch or 6 millimeters. Anything larger than that can be carcinogenic. 




‘E’ stands for evolving: The most significant indicator of a cancerous mole is that it changes over time. Try to see if the mole grows in size or changes its colors. It might even change its shape or become itchy. In some cases, one might even note bleeding.


Is it skin cancer? Read more about 6 usual signs you need to be aware of. Click Here!","Types Of Melanoma
Melanoma can be classified into the following types:
1. Cutaneous (skin) melanoma
There are four major types of cutaneous melanoma:


Superficial spreading melanoma: This is the most common form of the disease, responsible for about 70% of cases. This type usually develops in a pre-existing mole.




Nodular melanoma: This is the second most common, responsible for 15 to 30% of cases. These are more aggressive and usually develop more rapidly than superficial melanomas.




Lentigo maligna: This type of melanoma appears as large, flat lesions most commonly found on the faces of light-skinned women over the age of 50. This form of melanoma, responsible for about 4% to 10% of cases, has a lower risk of metastasis than other types.




Acral lentiginous melanoma: This occurs on the palms, soles of the feet or beneath the nail beds. They account for only 2% to 8% of melanomas in fair-skinned patients, but up to 60% of melanomas in darker-skinned patients. This type of melanoma is extremely aggressive and large, with an average diameter of three centimeters. 


2. Mucosal melanoma
Mucosal melanomas are rare, making up only about 1% of all diagnosed melanoma cases. This disease occurs in mucosal tissue, which lines body cavities and hollow organs like the nasal cavity, mouth and esophagus, rectum, urinary tract and vagina. It can be very hard to detect, and even when diagnosed and treated, the prognosis is poor.
3. Ocular melanoma
Because the eyes contain melanocytes, or pigment producing cells, they can be susceptible to melanoma. Two types of ocular melanoma include:


Uveal melanoma: It is a cancer (melanoma) of the eye involving the iris, ciliary body, or choroid (collectively referred to as the uvea).




Conjunctival: This is the melanoma of the conjunctiva that presents as a raised, pigmented or nonpigmented lesion that appears in adult life. 

","Causes Of Melanoma
Melanoma occurs when there is a problem with the melanocytes present in your body. Melanocytes are the cells that produce melanin, which gives color to your skin. Melanoma generally begins through moles, but most moles are not carcinogenic.Usually, healthy cells push the old cells through your skin, where they perish and fall off. But when cells have DNA damage, the new cells start multiplying abnormally and accumulate around the old cells, creating a cluster of cancerous cells. Even after several years of research, scientists have not pinpointed a precise reason behind melanoma development in a person. But there could be several factors that might be responsible for melanoma. The cancerous moles can be a result of DNA mutations. DNA mutations can cause different types of cancers. The gene mutations resulting in melanoma can be of two types:
1. Acquired gene mutations
Generally, the gene mutations that result in melanoma are acquired during a person's life rather than getting inherited. Sometimes these changes can occur randomly without any specific reason. But at other times, it can be linked to an external cause.One of the most common causes attributed to melanoma development is exposure to ultraviolet rays (UV). UV rays can damage skin cells and affect the genes responsible for cell growth, making them cancerous. Usually, UV ray exposure is because of the sun, but sometimes it can be caused by manufactured products such as tanning beds and tanning lamps. UV ray exposure does not cause cancer immediately - it might take several years to develop and manifest. Hence, melanoma is more common in adults rather than in children or teenagers. When melanoma develops in areas with no sun exposure, it is usually due to changes in different genes rather than the ones exposed to the sun. They can also be due to several environmental factors, but the most probable cause is genetic changes. 
2. Inherited gene mutations
People can also inherit the gene changes that are responsible for melanoma from their parents. However, this is a rare scenario. These people have specific DNAs that are more likely to develop melanomas, especially in regions exposed to the sun.","Risk Factors For Melanoma
There are several risk factors for melanoma. Some of these include:
1. Dysplastic moles
A dysplastic nevus is a type of mole that looks different from a common mole (nevi). The risk of melanoma is greatest for people who have a large number of dysplastic nevi. This risk is high especially for people with a family history of both dysplastic nevi and melanoma.
2. Fair skin
Melanoma occurs more frequently in people who have fair skin that burns or freckles easily (these people also usually have red or blond hair and blue eyes) than in people with dark skin. 
3. Ethnicity
Studies show that caucasians get melanoma far more often than do black people, probably because light skin is more easily damaged by the sun.
4. Personal or family history of melanoma or other skin cancers
People who have been treated for melanoma have a high risk of a second melanoma. Melanoma sometimes runs in families. Having two or more close relatives who have had this disease is a risk factor. When melanoma runs in a family, a doctor should check all family members regularly.
5. Atypical mole syndrome (formerly termed B-K mole syndrome, dysplastic nevus syndrome)
People with this inherited condition have many dysplastic nevi. If at least one close relative has had melanoma, this condition is called as familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome, or FAMMM.
6. Age
Melanoma is more likely to occur in older people, but it is also found in younger people. The median age of melanoma is around 50 years, which means that about half of people with melanoma are diagnosed when they are younger than 50 and about half are diagnosed when they are older than 50. Melanoma that runs in families may occur at a younger age.
7. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation
Experts believe that melanoma is related to an increase in the amount of time people spend in the sun. This disease is also more common in people who live in areas that are at higher altitudes.
8. Indoor tanning
People who use tanning beds, tanning parlors, or sun lamps have an increased risk of developing all types of skin cancer. Using indoor tanning devices is strongly discouraged.
9. Severe, blistering sunburns
People who have had at least one severe, blistering sunburn as a child or teenager are at increased risk of developing melanoma. Sun protection may reduce the risk of melanoma later in life. Sunburns in adulthood are also a risk factor for melanoma.Are you getting sunburns? Read more about natural remedies for sunburns. Tap To Read!
10. Weakened immune system
People whose immune system is weakened by certain cancers, by drugs given following organ transplantation, or by HIV are at increased risk of developing melanoma.The risk to cancer patients due to COVID-19! Any infection can possibly affect a cancer patient more than any healthy individual. For the patients undergoing chemotherapy, it is all the more challenging. Even amongst cancer patients, children are at maximum risk of getting affected due to this infection. Know about COVID -19 care plan. Read Now!
11. Other inherited conditions
People with specific inherited genetic conditions have an increased risk of developing melanoma. These conditions include:


Xeroderma pigmentosum: It is an inherited condition characterized by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight.

Retinoblastoma: It is cancer of the retina.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome: It is a rare hereditary or genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing cancer.

Werner syndrome: This syndrome is characterized by the dramatic, rapid appearance of features associated with normal aging.

Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes: It is a genetic condition that makes it more likely for a person to get breast, ovarian, and other cancers.

12. Socioeconomic status
Lower socioeconomic status has been linked to more advanced cases of melanoma at the time of detection.This could be because low socioeconomic status individuals have less risk perception and knowledge of the disease.","Diagnosis Of Melanoma
Several tests and procedures can be conducted to diagnose melanoma. Some of the standard tests include:
1. Physical exam
The doctor will first ask you various questions about your medical and health history. After that, they will inspect your skin to find any symptoms or signs that might indicate melanoma.
2. Biopsy
If the doctor finds a part of the skin that might be suspicious, they will examine that part of the skin. The doctor might take a tissue sample from that part of the skin and send it to a lab for biopsy. Types of biopsy include:


Shave (tangential) biopsy: A shave biopsy is useful in diagnosing many types of skin diseases and in sampling moles when the risk of melanoma is very low.




Punch biopsy: The doctor rotates the punch biopsy tool on the skin until it cuts through all the layers of the skin. The sample is removed and the edges of the biopsy site are often stitched together.




Excisional biopsy: It is done to examine a tumor that might have grown into deeper layers of the skin.




Incisional biopsy: An incisional biopsy removes only a portion of the tumor.


3. Biopsies of melanoma that may have metastasized (spread)
Biopsies of areas other than the skin may be needed in some cases. For example, if melanoma has already been diagnosed on the skin, nearby lymph nodes may be biopsied to see if cancer has spread to them. These include:


Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC): It may be used to biopsy large lymph nodes near a melanoma to find out if the melanoma has spread to them.




Surgical (excisional) lymph node biopsy: This procedure can be used to remove an enlarged lymph node through a small incision (cut) in the skin.




Sentinel lymph node biopsy: If melanoma has been diagnosed and has any concerning features (such as being at least a certain thickness), a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is often done to see if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, which in turn might affect treatment options. 


4. Imaging tests
Imaging tests can also be done to help determine how well treatment is working or to look for possible signs of cancer coming back (recurring) after treatment. These include:


Chest x-ray: This test might be done to help determine if melanoma has spread to the lungs.




Ultrasound: It uses sound waves to create images of the inside of your body on a computer screen. 




Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy: This is done to help guide a biopsy needle into a suspicious lymph node.




Computed tomography (CT) scan: The CT scan uses x-rays to make detailed, cross-sectional images of your body. 




CT-guided needle biopsy: CT scans can also be used to help guide a biopsy needle into a suspicious area within the body.




Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: MRI scans use radio waves and strong magnets instead and can be very helpful in looking at any tumor in the brain and spinal cord.




Positron emission tomography (PET) scan: A PET scan can help show if the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. It is most useful in people with more advanced stages of melanoma.




PET/CT scan: This lets the doctor compare areas of higher radioactivity on the PET scan with the more detailed appearance of that area on the CT scan.


5. Blood tests
Blood tests aren’t used to diagnose melanoma, but some tests may be done before or during treatment, especially for more advanced melanomas. These include:


Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)


Complete blood count (CBC)


Liver function tests (LFT)


Kidney function tests (KFT)

There are several different ways to reduce the risk of getting melanoma and all other types of skin cancer. 
1. Do not go out in the middle of the day
The sun is at its highest point during the middle of the day. It means that the sun's rays are more direct, which increases the chances of UV light exposure. UV light radiation is one of the primary risk factors for melanoma. To lower your chances of getting skin cancer, you should not go out often between 10 am and 4 pm. If you have to go out during the day, try to seek as much shade as possible.
2. Avoid getting suntans or sunburns
Accumulated sun exposure over your life can cause skin cancer later in life. Remember, there is no such thing as a healthy suntan and a blistering sunburn can significantly increase the chances of getting melanoma. 
4. Wear sunscreen all year long
Wearing sunscreen is one of the easiest ways to avoid getting a suntan or sunburn and protect your skin against the sun's UV rays. You should wear sunscreen all year long, even when the sky is cloudy. Ensure that the sunscreen has an SPF higher than 30 if you are out in the sun for extended periods. Also, reapply every two hours if you sweat or swim. 
Use sunscreen before going out in the sun! If you are trying to avoid getting melanoma in the future, the best way to ensure the safety of your skin is by regularly applying sunscreen. If you are going out for longer hours, get water-resistant sunscreen that has an SPF of 30 or higher.Learn the basics of using sunscreens the right way. Click Here!
5. Cover yourself
Always cover yourself completely when going out in the sun. Wear full-sleeved clothes, and favor darker colors and tighter clothing items. Also, cover your head with a broad-brimmed hat. The hat will provide better protection compared to a visor or a baseball cap. Finally, don’t forget to add a pair of sunglasses or UV-blocking glasses. 
6. Do not use tanning beds or lamps
Tanning beds and lamps tan your body using UV rays. Direct exposure to them can increase your chances of getting skin cancer. 
7. Examine your skin regularly
Make sure that you inspect your skin regularly and notice any new changes. Make sure that you note any new moles, unusual growths, freckles, birthmarks, or bumps. Try to check all parts of your body, even the ones that don’t receive sunlight. Also, go to a dermatologist once a year to get a body checkup.Early detection of cancer can be life-saving and can be easy to treat if it is in the initial stage at the time of diagnosis.Read about 8 common signs of cancer that you should be aware of. Read To Know!","Specialist To Visit 

Consult a dermatologist (skin doctor) if you see any changes in your skin that you think is new or if you are worried about your skin. If you are diagnosed with melanoma, you will be required to consult several different types of doctors and specialists. All these doctors will help deal with varying aspects of the disease and figure out the best treatment plan for you.Some common specialists you should consult include:


Dermatologist


Surgical oncologist


Radiation oncologist


Medical oncologist 


A surgical oncologist is a surgeon who has special training in performing biopsies and other surgical procedures in cancer patients.

A medical oncologist treats cancer using chemotherapy and other medications like targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Seek medical advice from our world-class professionals to diagnose and treat melanoma.Book An Appointment!","Treatment Of Melanoma
In its early stages, the easiest way to treat melanoma is through surgery. However, when melanoma spreads beyond the skin, several different methods might get used for treatment in its later stages. 
1. Removal of lymph nodes
It is a surgical method used if the melanoma has spread beyond the skin to the lymph nodes. The doctor will remove the affected lymph nodes and a small part of the surrounding area to stop the spread. 
2. Immunotherapy 
It is a drug treatment that is commonly recommended after surgery. There are two major types of drugs that are used in immunotherapy.Immune checkpoint inhibitors: These drugs enable the proteins in the immune system, which are disabled by the cancerous cells. Therefore, the immune system again starts attacking the cancer cells. Some common drugs include:


Nivolumab


Pembrolizumab


Ipilimumab


Cytokines: The body produces proteins called cytokines which help in boosting the immune system. In some cases, doctors recommend artificial cytokines for melanoma. These drugs make it difficult for cancer cells to divide and multiply. Some common drugs include:


Interferon Alpha 2A


Interferon Alpha 2B


Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2B


Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2A


3. Targeted therapy
In targeted therapies, drugs are aimed at a distinct point in the cancer cells responsible for multiplying and dividing abnormally. This therapy is unique to every patient, depending on how their cancer cells react to the drug.
4. Chemotherapy
These are drugs that kill cancer cells. These are often used as the last resort while treating melanoma. Some common chemotherapy drugs include:


Carboplatin


Abraxane


5. Radiation therapy
In this procedure, X-Rays or other high-energy beams are given to the patient to kill the cancer cells. It is suggested if the melanoma has spread to the lymph nodes and beyond, and can’t be treated by surgery. ","Home-Care For Melanoma
Diet might not be closely linked to melanoma, but it can help in building immunity and helping you fight against the side effects that can occur due to the drug treatments. Here are some things you can do to take care of melanoma at home:
1. Eat right
Protein-rich food like lean meats, eggs, low-fat dairy products, nuts, etc can be beneficial. Include whole grains in your diet like whole-wheat bread, oatmeal, brown rice, etc. Also try to eat fat from healthy sources like olive oil, nuts, seeds, etc. Avoid eating a lot of sweets or added sugars.In addition, you should eat foods rich in antioxidants and even take antioxidant supplements, if necessary. Studies have shown that green tea (known for its healing abilities and abundance of antioxidants) can inhibit the growth of melanocytic cells.Eat Your Way Out Of Cancer!

Some common complications of melanoma are:


Recurrence: Cancer always has a chance of recurring in your lifetime, even after it has been completely removed. It is best to check yourself regularly, even when the treatment is complete.


Metastasis: In this scenario, cancer can spread beyond the skin to the muscles, organs, and nerves of the body. 


Secondary infection: This is seen due to disruption of the normal skin barrier.


Scarring: Can result from the lesion itself or treatments.


Lymphedema: It refers to tissue swelling caused by an accumulation of protein-rich fluid systems. It commonly occurs secondary to the removal of lymph nodes but can result from cancer alone.


Depression and anxiety: A higher prevalence of anxiety and depression have been identified in patients with advanced melanoma compared to those with early disease.

Occurrence of white or yellow spots on the nail


Whitish or yellowish discoloration of the nail


Thickening of the nail


Brittle, crumbly, and easily breakable nails


The shape of the nail is distorted


Foul smelling nails

Your body has an art of letting you know when something is wrong somewhere. Your nails are no exception. Here’s what your nails can reveal about your health.Know More!
 ","Causes Of Nail Infection

Nail infections are commonly caused by bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas, or fungi like Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton, and Candida Albicans.","Types Of Nail Infection

Nail infections can be caused by microorganisms like bacteria, fungi and viruses as described below:
Bacterial nail infectionIf the infection is caused by bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas, it is called a bacterial nail infection or Paronychia. Based on the duration for which the nail infection persists, bacterial nail infections are divided into the following types -


Acute bacterial nail infection: This type of infection is caused by bacteria that cause inflammation in the surrounding areas. It may last for less than six weeks, causing pain around the area.


Chronic bacterial nail infection: This type of infection is also  caused by bacteria that cause inflammation in the surrounding areas. It lasts for more than six weeks, causing periodic, painful flare ups.


Fungal nail infection
If the infection is caused by fungi like Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton, Candida Albicans, it is called a fungal nail infection or Onychomycosis. Based on the area involved or the causative agent, fungal nail infections are further divided into the following subtypes -


Distal subungual onychomycosis: This is the most common type of onychomycosis where the fungal infection starts from the nail bed and spreads across the edges.


Proximal subungual onychomycosis: It is a rare type of onychomycosis which is usually seen in patients who suffer from immunocompromised states. The infection begins as white spots in the center of the nail and moves outward as the nail grows.


White superficial onychomycosis: This type of infection affects only the surface of the nail. It may cause white spots on the surface of the nail that turns powdery and can make the nail crumble.


Candida onychomycosis: This is caused by a fungus called Candida albicans. It is more commonly seen in nails that have been previously affected by injury or infection.


Viral nail infection
Viral warts can cause changes in the shape and thickness of the nails leading to a viral nail infection. It is usually caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV). In some cases, viruses can also lead to skin growth under the nail, known as Periungual warts. It may also lead to a condition known as Onychomadesis in which the nails begin to shed at the proximal end.","Risk Factors For Nail Infection

Chances of getting a nail infection are higher if


Age is more than 60 years.


Living and sharing toiletries with someone who has a nail infection.


You have diabetes or suffer from immunocompromised conditions, such as HIV or cancer or undergoing chemotherapy.


Nail infections occur if the nail is constantly exposed to moisture or trauma or both in conditions such as:


Wearing tight-fitting shoes or moist, dirty socks that allow no space for breathing.


Spending too much time in the water every day.


Wearing plastic gloves for a prolonged period.


Walking for a long time in hot and humid places, such as public showers.


An injury to the nail or surrounding area.


The chances of fungal infections increase during the summer season, owing to hot and humid weather conditions and excessive sweating. Here are a few ways to help you deal with fungal infections during the summer season.Read More!",,"Specialist To Visit 

For cases of acute bacterial, fungal and viral nail infection, immediate medical care must be sought. Acute nail infection develops with a break in the skin and is usually seen at the side of the nail. This type of nail infection is often caused by a bacterial infection but may also be caused by herpes, a type of viral infection. Symptoms of acute bacterial nail infection may include fever, swelling, pus formation around nails, or red streaks around nails.
 
For chronic infections, treatment must be started as soon as symptoms like discoloration or patchy nails are observed. Chronic nail infection occurs most often in people whose hands are constantly or often exposed to moisture. This disorder often results from contact dermatitis, a type of skin inflammation caused by exposure to chemicals that are irritating to the skin, and worsened due to fungus or bacteria.

","Treatment Of Nail Infection 

Treatment for nail infection broadly comprises -
Oral antibiotics: Usually, simple bacterial nail infections can be managed at home with topical antibiotic creams. Oral antibiotics are prescribed in more severe stages of infection. Available medicines are:


Ampicillin 


Doxycycline


Clindamycin


 Oral antifungals: Antifungals are given as oral medications to treat fungal nail infections. Available medicines are:


Itraconazole


Fluconazole 


Terbinafine


 Topical antibiotics: 


Mupirocin: It is an antibiotic medicine used to treat bacterial infection. It kills the bacteria that cause skin infections by preventing the synthesis of essential proteins necessary for the survival of bacteria. Thus, it prevents the infection from spreading.


Fusidic acid: It is an antibiotic that works by preventing synthesis of essential proteins required by bacteria to carry out vital functions. Thus, it stops the bacteria from growing, and prevents the infection from spreading.


Retapamulin: This antibiotic is helpful in treating bacterial infection by inhibiting the bacteria from growing, and prevents the infection from spreading.


Topical antifungals:These are available as creams, absorbent powders, or solutions for dressing to be applied directly to the infected nail:


Ciclopirox: These are available in a cream form or lacquer form that can be applied like a nail polish over the infected nail. They work by inhibiting protein synthesis in the fungal cells, thereby preventing further growth of the fungi.


Amorolfine: These are to be applied directly to the nails. They work by inhibiting the enzymes necessary for growth of fungal infection.


Antifungal dusting powder to prevent moisture in the affected area.


Topical antiseptics: In acute bacterial nail infection, the affected part may be soaked in a diluted antiseptic solution and can then be covered with antibiotic ointments. A few examples of antiseptics are: 


Povidone Iodine: Povidone Iodine is an antiseptic. It kills harmful infections causing microorganisms to prevent and treat infections.


Chlorhexidine: It is a disinfectant and antiseptic that is used for skin disinfection. It is also used for cleaning wounds, preventing dental plaque, and  treating yeast infections. 


Topical steroids: This class of drugs are the most powerful medicines used to lower inflammation in the body. When applied topically, it relieves the redness, swelling, itching and irritation of the skin that is caused due to nail infection. Methylprednisolone aceponate cream is the most common medicine used.
Surgery: In cases of severe nail infection, like collection of pus around the nail or the formation of abscess (pus), surgery may be required to drain the pus or abscess and remove the nail in extreme cases of disfigurement.
Laser therapy (Phototherapy): This is a treatment for fungal nail infection (onychomycosis). The laser devices emit a pulse of energy that penetrates through the toenail to the nail bed where the fungal growth is present. Fungal infections of the nails usually require several laser treatment sessions before they completely resolve.","Home Care For Nail Infection

If you suffer from a nail infection, you can do the following things to care for yourself at home -


Always keep the infected part clean and dry.


Before applying medications, wash hands thoroughly with soap and water.


Do not wear dirty socks or gloves.


Do not allow dirt to accumulate under the nail.


Trim your nails regularly with a sterile nail trimmer.


Do not share toiletries, such as towels or napkins, with anyone who has an infection.


Do not regularly cover nails with nail polish.

","Symptoms of Narcolepsy 
There are 5 signs and symptoms of narcolepsy, often represented by the acronym CHESS (cataplexy, hallucinations- usually visual, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, and sleep disruption). While all patients with narcolepsy may not experience all 5 symptoms except excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Symptoms of narcolepsy may develop suddenly over the course of a few weeks, or slowly over a number of years that may include:
1. Cataplexy
Cataplexy is sudden, temporary muscle weakness or loss of muscle tone. It can cause problems ranging from drooping eyelids to total body collapse, depending on the muscles involved. It also includes symptoms like:


Jaw-dropping


Head slumping down


Legs collapsing uncontrollably


Slurred speech


Note: These symptoms are often triggered by strong emotions such as fear, laughter, excitement, or anger. After the onset of EDS, symptoms of cataplexy may appear for weeks or even for years.
2. Hallucinations
When going to sleep or waking up, a person with narcolepsy may see or hear things that are not real. These delusional experiences are often vivid and frightening. If these delusions happen as you’re falling asleep are called hypnagogic hallucinations. If this happens when you’re waking up, then it is called hypnopompic hallucination.
3. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)
Most patients with narcolepsy have this symptom. EDS would interfere with everyday activities, even if you get enough sleep at night. The lack of energy, and concentration, memory lapses, and feeling depressed and exhausted makes it very difficult to perform daily activities.
4. Sleep attacks
In general, people with narcolepsy will experience sudden intervals of falling asleep, without warning. They may happen at any time. The length of these sleep attacks varies from person to person. It can last from seconds to several minutes. These sleep attacks may happen several times a day if narcolepsy is not well controlled or treated.
5. Sleep paralysis
People with narcolepsy may experience episodes of sleep paralysis. Which means a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. These episodes may last a few seconds to several minutes. Being unable to move can be frightening, although sleep paralysis does not cause any harm.
Other symptoms
Narcolepsy can also cause a number of other symptoms that include:


Memory problems


Depression


Headache


Automatic behavior- performing any task and suddenly falling asleep without consciously realizing they’re doing it.


Over 50% of narcolepsy cases remain undiagnosed because people feel embarrassed by the experience. Do not hesitate to take expert advice if you are facing any of the above-mentioned symptoms.Consult now","Types Of Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy can be classified into the following:
Type 1: Narcolepsy with cataplexy
This type comes without warning. It is characterized by a loss of muscle tone that causes weakness and makes you unable to control your muscles (cataplexy). People with this condition have high levels of hypocretin (and also muscle weakness triggered by emotions
Type 2: Narcolepsy without cataplexy
Individuals with type 2 narcolepsy have excessive sleepiness during the daytime but do not have cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness). They usually have fewer chronic symptoms and normal brain hormone hypocretin levels.
Secondary narcolepsy
This type is the rarest one. It may result from an injury to a deep part of the brain called the hypothalamus that regulates sleep. It may also be caused by a brain tumor or brain inflammation called encephalitis. Apart from narcolepsy’s usual symptoms, individuals may also have severe neurological problems and long periods of sleep (more than 10 hours) each night.

The exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown. However, many people with narcolepsy have less amount of a brain chemical known as hypocretin (orexin). It helps in regulating your sleep-wake cycles. Some experts believe that the deficiency of hypocretin levels and an immune system that attacks healthy cells (i.e an autoimmune issue), contributes to narcolepsy. But that is not the cause in all cases.

Causes of secondary narcolepsy 
Sometimes narcolepsy can occur as a result of underlying conditions that alter the production of hypocretin levels in the brain. For example, narcolepsy can develop after the following:


Head injury: Including trauma to the cranium and intracranial structures (Brain, Cranial nerves, meninges, and other structures)


Hypothalamic lesions: Abnormal growth in the hypothalamus gland, which is located in the brain that helps to maintain the stability and balance in our bodies.


Brain tumor: Narcolepsy due to brain tumors is usually seen in kids.


Encephalitis: Inflammation of the brain, mostly due to infection.


Multiple sclerosis: It is an autoimmune disease that damages the central nervous system.


Demyelinating disorders: A neurological condition that causes damage to the protective covering (myelin sheath) that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain, eyes (optic nerves), and the spinal cord.


Encephalomyelitis: It refers to the inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that damages (myelin sheath )the protective covering of nerve fibers.


Inherited disorders: Disorders like Niemann–Pick disease type C can also cause narcolepsy.
 
Did you know? 
Many patients with narcolepsy also have fragmented sleep, other sleep disorders, and obesity, probably as a consequence of orexin deficiency. Depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric problems are also common in these patients.  

","Diagnosis Of Narcolepsy

Diagnosis of narcolepsy can be quite tricky as it mimics other health conditions like depression, encephalitis, etc. Daytime sleepiness can also be a common side effect of certain medicines. TDiagnosis of narcolepsy includes:
1. History taking
The diagnosis of narcolepsy includes taking an extensive history of the patient that includes questions like:


Duration of sleep during the nighttime


Frequency of having difficulty sleeping


Daytime napping 


Any stressful event in the recent past


Medical condition if any


2. Blood tests
These tests are recommended to rule out any underlying health problems. They include:


Thyroid profile test


Complete blood count (CBC) 


3. Imaging tests
This helps to determine if there are any problems with the brain or nerves that may be responsible for problems with sleep. Imaging tests that are generally advised include: 


Computerized tomography scan (CT)


Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 


4. Sleep record tests (sleep log)
Your doctor will ask you to keep a journal of your sleep pattern for about a week. In that, you need to record the time at which you fall asleep, and the duration of sleep during the daytime as well as nighttime. 
5. Wrist actigraphy
It is a device used to detect movements during sleep. An actigraph is worn on the wrist during sleeping to keep track of your sleeping pattern. It also records body movements and can help distinguish wakefulness from sleep.
6. Polysomnography
The polysomnography (PSG) test requires you to spend a night in a sleep center or medical facility. It is used to record a set of parameters like brain waves, breathing, oxygen levels, heart rate, and eye and leg movements during sleep. This test reveals how quickly you fall asleep, how often you wake up during the night, and how often your sleep is disturbed (a common finding in people with narcolepsy). This is one of the essential tests to confirm narcolepsy.
7. Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)
MSLT measures how quickly and easily it takes you to fall asleep during the day. You may have this test after polysomnography. You’ll need to take several naps throughout the day, and an expert will analyze how quickly you enter into a sleep cycle. 
8. Measuring hypocretin levels
Experts believe that in many cases, narcolepsy is linked to a deficiency of hypocretin, also known as orexin, which regulates sleep-wake cycles. Measuring your level of orexin can be useful in diagnosing narcolepsy. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed using a needle during a procedure called a lumbar puncture and then tested for hypocretin levels.

Since the actual cause of narcolepsy is unknown, it is difficult to prevent it. However, here are a few effective habits that you can adopt to ensure that you get a good night’s sleep.



Avoid daytime naps


Fix your time for sleep. This includes sleeping and waking up at the same time every day. It keeps your biological clock in order.


Practicing a relaxing pre-bedtime ritual such as taking bath, reading, or listening to soft music helps to reduce your stress and improve sleep at night.


Sleep in a completely dark room as it will help in secreting melatonin hormone (it regulates the sleep-wake cycle) and promotes sound sleep.


Avoid using cell phones and watching TV prior to sleep time. The light from the screen interferes with the release of the melatonin hormone.


Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol at night or late evening as they can make you feel active and disturb your sleep cycle.


Avoid large meals and beverages before bedtime as it will stop your urge of using the washroom at night during sleep. 


Avoid a sedentary lifestyle and stay active during the daytime, as it can improve your sleep cycle.

People with narcolepsy usually become overweight because of lower activity levels and orexin deficiency. In the long term, their slower metabolism can cause obesity.
4. Stress & anxiety
Narcolepsy may lead to mental disorders such as stress and anxiety. However, depression is also common in people with narcolepsy. Uncontrolled sleep attacks can impair decision-making, damage relationships, and decline the overall quality of life.
5. Poor performance
The ability to concentrate is essential to learning and academic achievement. However, sleep attacks and other symptoms of narcolepsy can reduce attention and focus leading to poor performance.",,"Alternative Therapies Of Narcolepsy
Narcolepsy needs both medical and lifestyle management. Along with those there are a few alternative therapies that may help you to manage the symptoms of narcolepsy. They include:
1. MR therapy (meditation and relaxation)
One of the easy and effective remedies is meditation and relaxation therapy. MR therapy, especially mindfulness-based meditation helps ease psychological stress including anxiety, depression, and symptoms of narcolepsy. Steps for mindfulness meditation include:

Sit or lie in a comfortable position.
Focus on your natural breathing- inhale and exhale.
Allow your thoughts (positive or negative) to come and go without judgment.
Keep your body calm and relaxed.

2. Sleep-inducing teas 
In a few cases, people with narcolepsy have seen a disturbance in night sleep, or are unable to sleep at night. Teas like chamomile (babunah ke phul) tea, passion flower tea, red ginseng, peppermint (pudina) tea, and lavender tea can promote good sleep at night. 
3. Acupuncture and acupressure
These therapies are ancient healing arts based on components of traditional Chinese medicine. Acupressure helps to release tension in the muscles and pressure points and to encourage blood circulation by pressing certain areas of your body. In acupuncture therapy, thin needles are inserted into the body to ease the symptoms of narcolepsy including stress, and anxiety."

","Causes Of Nausea

Nausea is not a disease in itself. It occurs as a symptom of various diseases. Disturbances in the gastrointestinal tract, inner ear, or chemoreceptors (which are cells sensitive to chemicals) generate signals of being sick in the brain. The feeling of nausea is then produced as a response to these disturbances. 
 
Some of the common causes of nausea include:
Gastrointestinal conditions: Any issue that interferes with the normal functioning of the stomach and the gastrointestinal tract can lead to nausea. These issues are:


Stomach infection or gastroenteritis


Food poisoning


Gastric ulcers


Appendicitis


Hyperacidity


Intestinal obstruction


Cholecystitis


Crohn’s disease


Gallstones


Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)


Irritable bowel syndrome


Allergy to certain foods, like milk


Indigestion (or excessive food intake)


Ear and balance disorders:


Motion sickness


Meniere’s disease


Ear infection or otitis media


Vestibular neuritis


Pregnancy: Morning sickness or the feeling of nausea is a common occurrence in pregnancy especially during the first trimester.
Side effects of medications or therapies: Nausea can occur as a side effect of certain medications, such as chemotherapy drugs, NSAID painkillers, anesthetic drugs, and radiation therapy.
Self-inflicted: Sometimes, nausea and vomiting can be self-inflicted in severe eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia.
Other illnesses: The feeling of nausea is also seen with other health conditions, such as:


Allergy or anaphylaxis


Hyperthyroidism


Meningitis


Encephalitis


Hydrocephalus


Hepatitis


Migraine


Anxiety and depression


Claustrophobia


Excessive alcohol consumption


Heart attack


Cancer


Acute severe trauma


Nausea and vomiting in childrenVomiting in infants in the first few months can occur after feeding, known as spitting up. If the vomiting is projectile, meaning it occurs with a force and travels across a distance, it may suggest an abnormality in the stomach. Often gastrointestinal infections are also responsible for nausea and vomiting in children.
Here’s more on things to keep in mind if your child experiences vomiting. Click Here To Read!","Diagnosis Of Nausea

A single episode of nausea does not require any immediate diagnosis, as it is often self-limiting and can be easily cared for at home. A detailed evaluation of nausea is necessary when symptoms of nausea are recurring or chronic. A detailed history and clinical examination (including the eye and/ ear) with some specific investigations listed below help in identifying  the underlying cause of nausea: 
Lab Tests: Laboratory tests include-


Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for causes like anemia or active infections. 


Serum Electrolyte to evaluate the balance of electrolytes, such as sodium and potassium in the body. 


Protein Total, Serum checks the levels of human proteins, such as albumin, globulin, and the overall nutritional status.


Pregnancy Urine Test in females of reproductive age to check for suspected pregnancy.


Liver Function Test to check for the health of the liver and other possible causes of dysfunction of the liver. 


Tuning fork test: It is a screening test that uses a tuning fork to assess hearing loss which could be the cause of nausea.


Nystagmus: It is a condition where a person cannot control eye movement.This can lead to dizziness or nausea, and also vision problems, as the person is unable to hold a steady gaze.


Uremia test: It is a clinical condition which is characterised by high levels of urea in the blood. Nausea and vomiting may be caused by encephalopathic (damage or disease that affects the brain) or neurologic disorders (diseases of the brain, spine and the nerves that connect them) associated with uremia.


Kidney function test (KFT): As the kidney health declines, some non-specific symptoms develop such as vomiting, nausea, weakness and tiredness. 


These tests are performed to evaluate the overall health of a patient and diagnose the cause of nausea.
Imaging studies: If the cause of nausea is not established with physical evaluation and laboratory testing, certain imaging studies such as X-Ray abdomen, Dual phase CT abdomen, USG abdomen, and endoscopy, may be helpful in diagnosing gastrointestinal causes.
If nausea is suspected to result from problems in the central nervous system, an MRI of brain or CT scan (head) may be performed.",,"Prevention Of Nausea

Not all types of nausea can be prevented, especially those originating from causes related to the central nervous system. Certain types of nausea, especially those originating from gastrointestinal causes can be prevented by:


Eating fresh food, which is not spicy and oily.


Eating smaller portions throughout the day instead of larger meals.


Drinking liquids between two meals.


Avoiding activities that trigger motion sickness, such as joyrides, traveling long distances via road, etc.


Resting in a sitting position or elevated position after meals.


Avoiding pain killers like NSAIDs above the prescribed dosage.


Avoiding strong smells, such as deodorants, perfumes, or cooking odors, if they trigger nausea during pregnancy.

","Treatment Of Nausea

Mild episodes of Nausea and vomiting do not require medical treatments as they often resolve on their own. For chronic or severe nausea, the following treatment options are available.

1. Symptomatic relief for nausea

Antiemetic medicines: Antiemetic medicines help to control nausea and prevent vomiting. These are the first choice of treatment suggested to provide relief from the symptoms of nausea. They work by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter receptors involved in causing vomiting. Some of the common examples of antiemetic medicines include:

Domperidone
Ondansetron

Prochlorperazine 
Aprepitant

Antiemetics for morning sickness: To treat morning sickness, which is a common symptom seen in early stages of pregnancy, a combination of anti-nausea medicines are recommended. For example, doxylamine + Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine), a combination drug which is used to treat and prevent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Doxylamine is an antihistamine that blocks the action of certain natural substances in the body that may contribute to nausea and vomiting. Vitamin B6 is also known to have anti-nausea action. Your doctor may recommend the dose based on the severity of your symptom.Antihistamines: This class of medicines reduces or blocks the chemical histamine which is associated with allergy. These are helpful in treating nausea caused due to motion sickness or vertigo. Examples include: 


Promethazine 
Meclizine

Anticholinergic medications: This class of medicines acts by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This chemical is known to play a key role in managing numerous body functions. It also helps to control nausea and vomiting.
Prokinetic drugs: This class of medicines comes under prescription medicines. They promote normal contraction of the intestine and help in the emptying of the stomach. These are commonly recommended for people with GERD and given mostly in combination with medications that lower acid production in the body such as PPIs and H2 receptor blockers. Examples include:

Metoclopramide 
Itopride 


2. Treatment of underlying cause

This includes treating the underlying cause of nausea such as: 

Stomach infections with antibiotics
Vertigo with antivertigo drugs
Hyperacidity with antacids
Migraine with triptans
Chemotherapy side effects with anti-nausea drugs


3. Supportive Care

This includes supportive care with fluids and Oral Rehydrating Solutions (ORS) to replenish the loss of electrolytes in the body. These help in cases where the patient has lost excessive fluids due to vomiting and shows signs of dehydration. 

 
","Home Care For Nausea

Homecare for Nausea depends on whether it is a one-time episode or a chronic occurrence.
Home remedies for acute nausea
The following care can be taken when a person starts feeling nauseous: 


Sucking on ice chips or candies may help suppress nausea.


Ensuring appropriate hydration by consuming fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration.


Lying down in a propped-up position to settle the feeling of retching.


Avoiding heavy or spicy foods for at least 24 hours following an episode of nausea.


When vomiting cannot be averted, do not vomit while lying down. Vomit with your head positioned forward to prevent the risk of possible aspiration of vomit. Vomit aspiration in the lungs can cause serious health complications such as pneumonia.



Homecare for chronic nausea
The following care measures can be taken if a person suffers from chronic nausea in pregnancy, post-chemotherapy, vertigo, or other brain-related conditions: 


Pregnant women should avoid strong smells or foods that trigger nausea.


For procedures like chemotherapy or radiation, take prescribed antiemetic medications on time as advised.


Patients with vertigo and motion sickness must avoid activities that worsen the symptoms, like joy rides or road travel.


Individuals suffering from gastrointestinal conditions that cause nausea should avoid consuming spicy, oily, or processed food.

Relaxation techniques and breathing exercises: Exercises that promote overall body relaxation, such as breathing exercises, can help overcome feelings of nausea. Taking slow and deep breaths and holding breath for a short time after each breath is a simple breathing exercise to help you feel calm and may help ease nausea.
Aromatherapy: Aromatherapy can help reduce the feelings of nausea. It involves inhaling pleasant fragrances, such as peppermint oil fragrances or citrus fragrances which calm the sensation of nausea.
Acupressure and acupuncture: Acupressure and acupuncture techniques can help block the noxious stimuli that cause nausea by applying intense pressure to the peripheral trigger points. Applying pressure on the pressure point called Neiguan or P-6, which is on the inner arm, near the wrist helps reduce nausea.
Natural remedies: Sucking on small portions of certain natural foods, such as ginger candy or a piece of ginger with rock salt sprinkled on it, cumin seeds or powder, a piece of lemon, cinnamon stick, fennel seeds, etc., help overcome the feeling of nausea. These herbs and spices are known for their digestive properties, they help improve the taste sensation in the mouth and thus help suppress the sensation of nausea.","Complications Of Nausea

Worsening of acute episodes of nausea can lead to excessive vomiting, which can cause dehydration. In severe cases, it can lead to hypotension, shock, or loss of consciousness. It may result in poor nutrition as patients cannot consume or keep down solid food.
Vomit aspiration in the lungs is another serious complication of nausea. The aspirated fluid may collect in the lungs and cause pneumonia, which may be severe in some cases.
Malnutrition and weight loss is another complication seen in patients with chronic nausea, as they often avoid consuming full meals out of fear.

","Symptoms Of Neck Pain
A few of the symptoms associated with neck pain include:
1. Dizziness and unsteadiness
Dizziness and unsteadiness can be caused by inflammation or compression of the nerves in the neck. The most common cause of this is an injury after an accident, but it could also be due to repeated stress on the neck muscles.
2. Movement barrier
If you notice that you are unable to move your neck as per your normal requirement and there is a distinct stiffness, this is a movement barrier, a symptom of painful issues with your neck. 
3. Frequent headaches

4. Pain in other areas
Any imbalance that puts additional strain on the network of nerves in the neck region, may result in shoulder, chest, arm, wrist, and hand discomfort.",,"Causes Of Neck Pain
Neck pain is common for individuals who have a bad posture with their shoulders slouched forward and upper back rounded. This puts tremendous pressure on the vertebrae of the neck and can lead to conditions such as cervical spondylosis (wear-and-tear injuries of the spine) and cervical compression fractures (injuries resulting from compression of the spinal cord). Some primary causes of neck pain are as follows:


Muscle strain: Excessive use of the muscles in the neck, such as spending too much time crouched over a computer or smartphone, often results in muscular strains. Even activities, such as reading on the bed or grinding teeth, may cause the neck muscles to get strained.

Worn joints: As with the rest of the body’s joints, even the neck joints deteriorate with age. Osteoarthritis deteriorates the cushioning (cartilage) between the bones (vertebrae). Following that, the body creates bone spurs that impair joint mobility, leading to discomfort, even in the neck.

Compression of the nerves: Herniated discs or bone spurs in the neck vertebrae might compress the nerves that branch from the spinal cord.

Injuries: Whiplash damage is often the outcome of rear-end vehicle crashes. Whiplash occurs when the head is jerked backward and then forward, straining the neck’s soft tissues. 

Other diseases: Neck discomfort may be caused by numerous conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, meningitis, and cancer.
","Risk Factors For Neck Pain
There are a number of factors that increase the risk of neck pain like a sedentary lifestyle, sitting in front of a computer for prolonged periods of time, and carrying heavy bags around. One risk factor that many people don't think about is the number of times they sleep on their stomachs. This increases the likelihood of experiencing neck pain due to poor posture and muscle imbalance between your head and torso.Other risk factors include:1. Age: The risk for neck pain increases with age. As you get older, your neck muscles tend to weaken. This makes it more difficult to support the head during rapid changes in posture or movement. 2. Gender: Females are thought to be at a higher risk for getting neck pain. 3. Excessive weight: Obesity is an important risk factor for developing neck pain because excess weight puts pressure on the spine and interferes with its normal function.Know more about healthy diet plans and weight loss tips that can work for you.Read This!4. Height: Taller people are more likely to suffer from neck pain than shorter people.5. History of lower back pain: Neck and back pain can also be related because a problem in one area of the body can lead to changes in posture and movement that negatively affect the other area.6. Accidents: Any injuries during contact sports, motor-vehicle accidents, horse riding, etc. are a risk factor for neck pain.7. Occupation: People with desk jobs or manual labor jobs (construction workers, carpenters, etc. have a higher risk of developing neck pain. Studies show that dentists, nurses, office workers, and crane operators have been shown to have a higher prevalence of neck pain.Do you stare at computers all day?

Stress and anxiety: Stress is related to pain and disability and perceived as a risk factor for neck pain. Also, neck pain has been found to be comorbid with anxiety.9. Depression: Mood disorders, especially depression, have been found to be related to chronic neck pain and disabilities.","Prevention Of Neck Pain
Neck pain is a common problem. One of the most common causes of neck pain is poor posture. This leads to improper use of muscles in the neck and spine, which leads to chronic pain. Below are some preventive measures that can be taken to ensure proper posture in order to relieve neck pain:
1) Exercise regularly 
It is advisable to exercise regularly so that your body doesn’t stiffen up when you are inactive. Aim for a 30-minute cardio workout 5 times a week.Too lazy to sweat? To understand 7 simple tricks to help you exercise daily.Read Now!
2) Perform stretching exercises for the neck
Keep your neck muscles fit by performing short sets of stretching and strengthening exercises throughout the day. 
3) Maintain a healthy weight
Obesity or being overweight can predispose to neck pain. Hence, it is important to maintain the body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 24.What is BMI? Read more.Read Now!
4) Stay hydrated
Drink an adequate amount of water during the day. It helps to hydrate the discs between the vertebrae in the neck. These discs are mostly made up of water, so staying well hydrated will help keep your discs supple and strong. It is recommended to drink at least 8 large glasses of water per day unless advised otherwise by your doctor.
5) Maintain a good posture
Incorrect posture can cause neck pain by straining the muscles and ligaments that support the neck.The head-and-shoulders-forward posture in which the neck slants forward, placing the head in front of the shoulders is the most common example of poor posture which adds to neck pain. This posture causes the upper back to slump forward as well, putting a strain on the entire spine.
6) Avoid straining the neck


Do not try to lift by bending your back. Squat down and reach your load by bending your hips and knees and then straighten your legs. Keep your load near your body and then straighten your legs to lift. 


People tend to carry their bags on one side resulting in uneven load. This leads to pain in the neck and shoulder area. Whenever you have to carry a bag, make sure that the shoulders are at the same level or else you can use a backpack which will distribute the load evenly.


7) Use electronic gadgets correctly


Make sure that your mobile device is at your eye level while working. Avoid texting or looking down at your mobile device for a long duration of time.


Use any type of hands-free device, such as a headset or earpiece in case you spend a lot of time on the phone.


Put your phone out of reach when you sleep.


Adjust the monitor/laptop height. Your vision should be directly in the top-third of your computer screen. If you find you have to look down, raise your monitor up.


Laptops most often require you to angle your head downward to see the screen, so connecting your laptop to a separate monitor, or screen, can be beneficial.


8) Make safety a priority


Always wear a seat belt while traveling in the car to prevent whiplash injury.


Use proper sports equipment to protect the neck while playing sports, that can easily lead to neck injuries eg, football, basketball.


9) Wear a neck brace

3. Injections
In case of severe neck pain, a physician may inject a small amount of local anesthetic and/or medication to numb a joint and provide pain relief.Injection of anti-inflammatory medicine like a corticosteroid might also be used around the nerves in the neck.
4. Surgery
Surgery is usually not indicated for neck pain, though it might be considered for alleviating nerves or spinal cord compression. Along with surgery, drugs like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], opioids, benzodiazepines, gabapentin, neurontin, and cortisone injections are also used to boost the recovery process.","Home-Care For Neck Pain
Neck pain can be disturbing and might interfere with daily activities. Home care, a break from sports, gyming, or any other physical activity is recommended. At the early stage of any neck injury, a doctor must be consulted and heavy lifting must be avoided. Other tips that you can follow include:
1. Gently massage the affected areas
You can lower your shoulders and identify the sore spot and then gently massage your neck with essential oils for immediate relief. Essential oils like peppermint or lavender oil are known to be beneficial. 
2. Exercise daily 
Stretching is a great form of exercise that can be very helpful if you have a stiff neck. Moving your head gently will increase the blood flow in a particular area and reduce inflammation.
3. Adjust your sleep positions
Sleeping on your back is the best position for your neck. You can also sleep on your side, but never on your stomach. Choose a rounded pillow to support the natural curve of your neck, with a flatter pillow cushioning your head.
4. Apply hot or cold compresses
A hot or cold compression can help you to get quick relief from a stiff neck. It is recommended to use ice for the first 24 to 48 hours to reduce swelling, followed by heat to loosen muscles and improve stiffness.
5. Take hot showers
Warm water bath can help you relax and soothe the tightened muscles, and nothing is better than adding a little Epsom salt. The salt helps to reduce inflammation and improve blood flow.

Nerve damage: Cervical radiculopathy, commonly called a ""pinched nerve,"" occurs when a nerve in the neck is compressed or irritated where it branches away from the spinal cord.


Depression: Living with chronic back or neck pain can lead to depression, feelings of stress, anxiety, sadness, and other mental health-related symptoms.


Weight gain: Having excessive weight gain can also lead to a bad posture where your head is slightly pushed forward and your back is curved. This puts more weight on the neck and shoulders, causing them to strain.

","Types Of Neonatal Jaundice
Jaundice can be classified into a few different types in newborns. They are as follows:


Physiological jaundice: This is the most common type and is normal. Physiological jaundice develops in most newborns by the 2nd or 3rd day. It occurs after the development of the liver and it starts to get rid of excess bilirubin. Physiological jaundice usually isn’t serious and goes away on its own within two weeks. 




Pathological jaundice: Jaundice is considered pathologic if it presents within the first 24 hours after birth, with a rise in the total serum bilirubin level more than 5 mg per dL per day or is higher than 17 mg per dL. It can present itself in infants who have signs and symptoms suggestive of serious illness.




Breastfeeding jaundice: this type of jaundice is more common in babies that are breastfed and it is the baby’s first week of life. It happens due to a lack of breast milk due to nursing difficulties or because your milk hasn’t come in yet. Breastfeeding jaundice may take longer to go away.




Breast milk jaundice: Substances in breast milk can affect how the baby’s liver breaks down bilirubin leading to bilirubin buildup. Breast milk jaundice may appear after your baby’s first week of life and may take a month or more to disappear.

Babies who are born premature (too early) are more likely to develop jaundice than full-term babies. The main sign is yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes which usually appears between the second and fourth day after birth. Bilirubin levels typically peak between the third and seven days after birth.To check for jaundice in the newborn, press gently on your baby's forehead or nose. The sign of jaundice is the skin looks yellow in the area that was pressed, in case of mild jaundice. If the baby doesn't have jaundice, the skin color should simply look slightly lighter than its normal color for a moment.Along with the skin becoming yellow, other symptoms that are quite rare include:


Very light yellow or very dark brown urine. 


Yellow mustard color (normal) to light beige stool.

 ","Causes Of Neonatal Jaundice
The causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into two distinct categories namely:


Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia: Also called direct hyperbilirubinemia usually results from increased production, impaired uptake by the liver, and decreased conjugation of bilirubin.


Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: Pathologic elevation of conjugated or direct bilirubin concentration higher than 2 mg/dL or more than 20% of total bilirubin.


Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia(UHB) or indirect hyperbilirubinemia
Based on the mechanism of bilirubin elevation, the etiology of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be subdivided into the following three categories:
1. Increased bilirubin production: This is due to the following causes:


Immune-mediated hemolysis - Which includes blood group incompatibilities such as ABO and Rhesus (RH) incompatibility. If the mother's blood has antibodies that do not work with the blood type of a baby, the newborn will experience blood incompatibility and ABO and RH are the two most common types of incompatibilities.


Blood group testing is done to determine a person's blood group (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh type. Understand better about blood grouping and how it is done.Click Here!


Non-immune mediated hemolysis: That includes : 


RBC membrane defects like hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis (changes in the shapes of RBCs) 


RBC enzyme defects like glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinases deficiency


Sequestration like a blood clot or bleeding between the skull and scalp, intracranial hemorrhage; polycythemia (type of blood cancer), and sepsis.




2. Decreased bilirubin clearance: It is due to the following syndromes:


Crigler Najjar syndrome: Is a severe condition characterized by hyperbilirubinemia.


Gilbert’s syndrome: A common, harmless liver condition in which the liver doesn't properly process bilirubin.


3. Miscellaneous causes: Other miscellaneous causes include: 


Congenital hypothyroidism


Drugs like sulfa drugs, ceftriaxone, and penicillins


Intestinal obstruction


Pyloric stenosis (blockage of food from entering the small intestine)

",,"Prevention Of Neonatal Jaundice
There’s no real way to prevent neonatal jaundice. But certain measures can be taken to create awareness like:


Government and public health organizations should arrange seminars, workshops and train mothers regarding neonatal jaundice. 


Medical scientists should develop new treatments and preventive measures having little or no side effects and capable of recovering babies more effectively. 


Partners should screen their ABO blood groups as well as Rh factor before marriage. 


Marriages between closely related individuals should be avoided.


After birth, the baby should be tested for blood incompatibilities.If the baby does have jaundice, there are ways to prevent it from becoming more severe. They are:


Making sure the baby is getting enough nutrition through breast milk. 


Feeding the baby 8 to 12 times a day for the first several days. This ensures bilirubin passes through their body more quickly.


Giving 1 to 2 ounces of formula every 2 to 3 hours for the first week in case the baby is not on breast milk. 


Monitoring the baby for the first five days of life for the symptoms of jaundice, such as yellowing of the skin and eyes.

","Specialist To Visit
Most cases of neonatal jaundice are normal, but sometimes it can be an indicator of an underlying medical condition. The doctor to consult in this case is a pediatrician. Contact the doctor if:


The spread of jaundice is more severe and rapid.


The baby’s yellow coloring gets darker.


The baby develops a fever over 38°C (100°F).


The baby is not taking milk, appears restless or lethargic, and cries at a high pitch.


If your baby is experiencing any such symptoms, seek help from world class doctors at 1mg.Consult Now!","Treatment Of Neonatal Jaundice

Treatment is usually only needed in babies with high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Usually, the condition gets better within 10 to 14 days and will not cause any harm to the baby. The treatments are recommended to reduce the risk of a rare but serious complication of newborn jaundice and kernicterus, which can cause brain damage. If the baby's jaundice does not improve over time, or tests show high levels of bilirubin in their blood, they may be treated with the following: 

Phototherapy

Phototherapy is treatment with a special type of light (not sunlight). It's sometimes used to treat newborn jaundice by making it easier for your baby's liver to break down and remove the bilirubin from your baby's blood.Phototherapy aims to expose your baby's skin to as much light as possible. This procedure consists of:


Placing the baby under a light either in a cot or incubator with their eyes covered.


A break is given after 30 minutes to feed the baby, change their nappy and cuddle them.


Intensified phototherapy may be offered if the baby's jaundice does not improve.


This involves increasing the amount of light used or using another source of light, such as a light blanket, at the same time.


Treatment cannot be stopped for breaks during intensified phototherapy.


During phototherapy, the baby's temperature is regularly monitored to make sure they're not getting too hot, and look for signs of dehydration. Intravenous fluids may be needed if the baby is becoming dehydrated and not able to drink enough.The bilirubin levels will be tested every 4 to 6 hours, in the beginning, to check if the treatment is working and once the bilirubin levels stabilize or start to fall, they will be checked every 6 to 12 hours.Phototherapy will be stopped once the bilirubin levels fall to a safe level, (which usually takes 2 days). It is generally very effective for neonatal jaundice and has few side effects.Note: As long as the level of bilirubin is not very high, the phototherapy treatment can be done at home with a special blanket called a “bili” blanket.
Exchange transfusion
If the baby has a very high bilirubin level in their blood or phototherapy has not been effective, they may need a complete blood transfusion, known as an exchange transfusion.During an exchange transfusion, a thin plastic tube will be placed in blood vessels in the umbilical cord, arms, or legs to remove the blood. The blood is replaced with blood from someone with the same blood group. As the new blood will not contain bilirubin, the overall level of bilirubin in the baby's blood will fall quickly.The baby will be closely monitored throughout the transfusion process to treat any problems that may arise, such as bleeding. Post the transfusion the baby's blood will be tested within 2 hours of treatment to check if the process was successful.The procedure may need to be repeated if the level of bilirubin in your baby's blood remains high.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
If the jaundice is caused by RH incompatibility intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be used. IVIG is usually only used if phototherapy alone has not worked and the level of bilirubin in the blood is continuing to rise.

Kasai operation (hepatic portoenterostomy)
Newborns diagnosed with biliary atresia or Type IVb choledochal cyst require a Kasai operation (hepatic portoenterostomy) to allow for bile drainage. This procedure should preferably be done within two months of life for the best outcomes. 

Other treatments

Treatment of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia depends on the cause such as:


If jaundice is caused by an underlying health problem, such as an infection, this usually needs to be treated.


Metabolic causes of cholestasis respond well when there is an improvement in the primary disorder and liver functions.


Parenteral nutrition (PN)-induced cholestasis is managed with cyclic PN, reducing the duration of exposure and starting initial feeds as early as possible. Manganese and copper content of PN should be reduced to minimize liver injury.

","Home-care For Neonatal Jaundice

Neonatal jaundice is quite common here are a few tips to take care of newborns at home:


Keep the pediatrician updated about any changes in the baby’s condition and call immediately if the yellowing of the baby’s skin becomes darker than before.


Make sure that the baby is well-fed.


Even the cause of jaundice may be breastfeeding, continuing to feed the infant in accordance with the doctor’s guidelines.


Breastfeeding should be done at least 8 to 12 times a day, whereas bottle-fed infants should be given at least 6 to 10 feedings in a day.


Expose the newborn to direct sunlight for prolonged periods.


Monitor the baby carefully to see if there is any rise in the temperature, loss of appetite, or restlessness. 


Ensure that the baby is hydrated sufficiently.


Feed the baby frequently with supplementation to prevent weight loss.

","Complications Of Neonatal Jaundice
Newborns with severe hyperbilirubinemia are at a higher risk of developing the following complications:

1. Bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND)
It refers to the clinical signs associated with bilirubin toxicity such as hypotonia (decreased muscle tone) followed by hypertonia (increased muscle tone) and/or opisthotonus (muscle spasm) or retrocollis (repetitive muscle contraction in the neck) and is typically divided into acute and chronic phases. It occurs as bilirubin binds different parts of the brain causing neurotoxicity.

2. Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE)
Potentially devastating conditions that can lead to death or life-long neurodevelopmental handicaps. It is characterized by lethargy, hypotonia, and decreased suck. At this stage, the disease is reversible.

3. Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus)
If ABE progresses, then the infants can develop kernicterus, which is then irreversible. It occurs due to brain damage as a result of high serum bilirubin levels. It manifests as involuntary twitching, cerebral paralysis, seizures, arching, posturing, gaze abnormality, and hearing loss.

4. Neonatal cholestasis
Patients with neonatal cholestasis are at risk of developing liver failure, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in a few cases. Long-standing cholestasis may also lead to failure in gaining weight and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.","Alternative Therapies For Neonatal Jaundice
The common option for treating neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and preventing any neurologic damage is the use of phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion. Some of the alternatives in the treatment of neonatal jaundice are:

Metalloporphyrins

Metalloporphyrins (synthetic heme analogs) are competitive inhibitors of heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in bilirubin production. Their use has been proposed as an attractive alternative strategy for preventing or treating severe hyperbilirubinemia.Specifically, tin-protoporphyrin (SnPP) and tin-mesoporphyrin (SnMP) are being used experimentally to prevent and treat neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

Natural remedies
1. Magnesium: A study showed that pregnant women who took 250 mg of magnesium daily for 6 weeks can reduce the risk of excess bilirubin production. Try adding magnesium-rich foods to your diet if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. Read more about tests to detect magnesium deficiency.Click Here!
2. Probiotics: Probiotic supplementation in newborns can help significantly improve jaundice symptoms by decreasing bilirubin levels that cause jaundice and helping the body clear out excess bilirubin.3. Barely seed flour: Researchers have found that barley seed flour sifted over a baby’s skin along with light exposure improved jaundice in newborn babies. The barley flour acts as an antioxidant and helps decrease indirect bilirubin levels. This is a traditional Iranian remedy."

","Symptoms Of Obesity
 
The symptoms of obesity can vary from person to person. Some of the most common symptoms include:


A history of weight gain


Excess body fat, particularly around the waistline


Shortness of breath or chest pain


Snoring while sleeping


Insomina or trouble sleeping


Sleep apnea (breathing is irregular and periodically stops during sleep)


Excessive sweating


Tiredness or fatigue ranging from mild to severe


Inability to perform simple physical tasks that one could easily perform before weight gain


Osteoarthritis in weight-bearing joints, especially the knees


Pain in joints, especially in the back and knees


Swelling and varicose veins in legs


Skin infections from moisture accumulating in the folds of skin


Stretch marks


Psychological issues such as low self-esteem, depression, and social isolation

",,"Causes Of Obesity
 
The root cause of obesity is not restricted to a single cause but many different factors. The leading factors that contribute to obesity are lack of exercise, excessive calorie intake, genetics, emotional stress, and sedentary lifestyle. Obesity is also caused by energy imbalance (between energy intake and expenditure). This means that there is more food energy coming in than going out. If this continues, the person will gain weight until they are obese or overweight. Many factors may contribute to obesity such as:
1. Genetic factors
Obesity tends to run in families. A child with a single obese parent has a 3-fold risk to become obese while a child with obese parents has a 10-times higher risk of obesity in future.Genes can affect appetite and thus, how much food you consume. They also control how quickly the body burns calories at rest and during exercise. Genes also influence fat regulation and places of body fat accumulation, particularly fat in the abdomen and around the waist. Very rarely, mutations in the following genes can cause obesity:


The ob gene: This gene controls the production of leptin, a hormone made by fat cells and placenta. Leptin controls weight by signaling the brain to eat less when body fat stores are very high. A mutation in the ob gene prevents leptin production and results in severe obesity in a very small number of children.


The gene for the melanocortin 4 receptor: Melanocortin 4 receptors are located mainly in the brain and play a key role in the regulation of energy. A mutation in this gene may account for obesity in 1 to 4% of children.


However, it should be noted that families not only share genes but also environment, and separating the two factors is quite difficult. In other words, you could be genetically predisposed to being overweight, but your genes may not get activated if you have the right environment and lifestyle. 
2. Aging
Obesity can occur at any age, even in children and teenagers. However, obesity becomes more common with age as the amount of muscle tissue decreases as you age. The result is a higher percentage of body fat and a lower basal metabolic rate (because muscle burns more calories). These changes also reduce the need for calories. So, if you don't consciously control what you eat and become more physically inactive as you age, you are most likely to gain weight.
3. Physical inactivity
A major factor that contributes to obesity is inactivity or lack of physical activity. Technological advances such as elevators, cars, remote controls, and online shopping have reduced the amount of calories burnt. More time is spent doing sedentary activities such as watching television, using the computer, smartphones, and playing video games.Also, many people have desk jobs where they sit for hours without any breaks. This can lead to obesity in some people because their bodies are not burning enough calories when they are sitting at stretch for hours. 
4. Unhealthy diet 
Modern day diet has significantly shifted to energy-dense foods, which have a large number of calories in a relatively small amount. Most of these foods contain more processed carbohydrates, and trans fat, and less fiber. Fats, by nature, are energy dense. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, which in turn stimulate the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin promotes the growth of fat tissue and can cause weight gain.More food advertisements promote high-fat, high-sugar, junk foods like biscuits, namkeen, candy, fizzy drinks, soda, and packaged foods than healthier options like whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Advertised products are designed to be cheap, have a long shelf-life and are specifically engineered to be addictive and irresistible. These convenience foods significantly contribute to obesity. 
5. Frequency of eating
It has been observed that people who eat small meals four or five times daily, have lower cholesterol levels and lower weight and/or more stable blood sugar levels than people who eat big two or three large meals daily. Hence, large and fewer meals can predispose you to gain weight.
6. Eating disorders
The following eating disorders are associated with obesity:


Binge eating disorder is characterized by binging i.e.; eating large amounts of food during a short amount of time and usually by feeling guilty or out of control. 


Night-eating syndrome involves not eating enough during the day and consuming a lot of food or calories in the evening. It also involves awakening in the middle of the night to eat. 


7. Medical conditions
Certain medical conditions can lead to weight gain and eventually might lead to obesity. These include:


Cushing syndrome is caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. It mostly causes fat to accumulate in the face (called moon face), and behind the neck (called a buffalo hump).


Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) causes obesity in affected women. Levels of testosterone and other male hormones are increased, which causes fat to accumulate in the waist and abdomen.


Hypothyroidism makes the body use less of the energy that one eats as food. The extra energy is more likely to be stored in the body as fat leading to obesity.


Insulin resistance is a condition which acts as a precursor for developing type 2 diabetes and can also predispose to obesity.


Osteoarthritis causes joint pain that may lead to reduced physical activity and thereby cause obesity.


Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition, present at birth that causes uncontrolled hunger.


8. Certain drugs
Many drugs used to treat certain diseases increase the risk of weight gain. These include:


Antidepressants


Antiseizure drugs, such as carbamazepine


Antihypertensives such as beta-blockers


Corticosteroids


Some anti-diabetics


Oral contraceptives


If this issue concerns you, you should discuss your medications with your doctor rather than discontinuing them, as this could have serious side-effects.
9. Pregnancy and menopause
Gaining weight during pregnancy is normal and necessary. However, some women find this weight difficult to lose after the baby is born. This weight gain may predispose to the development of obesity. Having several children close together may compound the problem. If a pregnant woman is obese or smokes, weight regulation in the child can be disturbed, leading to weight gain during childhood and later.Many women tend to gain weight after menopause. This weight gain may result from reduced activity and hormonal changes may cause fat to be redistributed and accumulated around the waist. 
10. Gut microbiota
Normally, the gut bacteria or gut flora help in digestion of food among other functions. However, an altered gut microenvironment such as long term use of antibiotics, may increase the risk of obesity. Changes in the number and types of bacteria in the digestive system may change how the body processes food.
11. Exposure to chemicals
Obesogens are chemicals that disrupt normal development and metabolism. Being exposed to obesogens early in life can increase the risk of developing obesity. These include cigarette smoke, bisphenol A, air pollution, flame retardants, phthalates, and polychlorinated biphenyls.
12. Psychological factors
Many people eat excessively in response to emotions such as boredom, sadness, stress, anxiety or anger. Adverse childhood events or a childhood history of verbal, physical, or sexual abuse are also associated with a higher risk of obesity. 
13. Lifestyle factors
Sleep deprivation or lack of the right amount of sleep can result in weight gain. Sleeplessness results in hormonal changes that increase appetite and cravings for energy-dense foods.Cessation of smoking usually results in weight gain. When nicotine is stopped, people tend to eat more food, and their metabolic rate decreases, so that fewer calories are burned. As a result, body weight may increase, sometimes leading to obesity.
14. Socioeconomic factors
Obesity and socioeconomic issues are also related. Lack of money to buy healthy foods or familiarity with healthy ways of cooking can increase the risk of obesity. So does lack of safe places to walk or exercise.",,,"Treatment Of Obesity
Obesity is a chronic and complex disease with significant health consequences. In case, lifestyle changes don't work, then consult your healthcare provider to evaluate the need of the next level of treatment -- medications and surgery.
Medications
The drugs that are used to treat obesity are called anti-obesity drugs. These drugs work by decreasing appetite, increasing the rate at which the person burns calories, or decreasing how much food is absorbed from one’s diet. The following drugs are prescribed for obesity:1) Orlistat 
Orlistat works by reducing the absorption of fats from food in the gut. It also reduces appetite and promotes feeling of fullness leading to weight loss. It is a prescription medication that can be taken for a long time.2) Rimonabant
Rimonabant is a cannabinoid receptor agonist. It has been found to reduce appetite and body weight and to cause a reduction in the body mass index (BMI).3) Phentermine
Phentermine is a drug that slows down the activity of your brain to reduce your appetite. It also increases the amount of energy that you expend during physical activity, which means that you will burn more calories than you usually would.4) Lorcaserin
Lorcaserin, on the other hand, helps suppress appetite and increase weight loss through serotonin activity in the brain.These drugs are used in combination with behavioral therapy and other lifestyle changes to reduce weight gain or improve weight loss. One problem with these drugs is that they may lead to side effects like nausea, vomiting, dizziness, dry mouth, etc.
Bariatric surgery
This surgery reduces the size of the stomach so that it can’t hold as much food as before. Surgery for obesity may be suggested in the following obese patients:


Patients with a BMI more than 40 


Patients with a BMI more than 35 who have serious medical conditions like sleep apnea that would improve with weight loss


Currently, the following types of bariatric surgeries are advised:


Restrictive surgeries: These surgeries restrict the size of the stomach and slow down digestion.


Malabsorptive/restrictive surgeries: These surgeries restrict the size of the stomach and also bypass or remove some part of the digestive system to reduce absorption of food.

",,"Home-care For Obesity
Here are some tips that can help you take care of obese people at home:


Monitor their diet and exercise habits by maintaining a diet journal.


Educate them on the risks posed by obesity.


Take steps to promote healthy living.


Improve their self-esteem.


Encourage them to eat healthily.


Plan the meals together.


Exercise together by going on a walk or doing some other physical activity you both enjoy.


Give them enough time to rest and sleep every day.


Stop their unhealthy habits like smoking or drinking alcohol.


Keep them hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.

",,"Complications Of Obesity
The complications of obesity are many and varied. The risks range from several serious medical conditions to a poor quality of life. It also has negative effects on the person’s social, physical, mental, and emotional health.There are many complications of being obese. These include:

Management of OCD is not a one-time thing but a daily effort. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help tackle OCD symptoms better. Apart from this, there are certain supplements and herbs that can provide some relief from the symptoms of OCD. They include:
Add the essential supplements


Vitamin D: Studies suggest that Vitamin D has a neuroprotective effect and vitamin D deficiency is associated with numerous neuropsychiatric diseases that include autism, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and OCD.




Vitamin B12, folic acid, and homocysteine: Studies have investigated the association between OCD and vitamin B12, folic acid, and homocysteine levels in adult and child-adolescent patients.




Selenium: It is an antioxidant, research shows that decreased selenium levels are found in individuals with OCD.




Zinc: it is an antioxidant trace element that is required for many processes such as gene expression, protein synthesis, and enzymatic catalysis. Zinc is essential for the normal functioning of the nervous system.




N-acetyl cysteine (NAC): Studies show that a patient with SSRI-refractory OCD showed there was a significant improvement in their symptoms by taking NAC.




Glycine: Glycine is an amino acid that is associated with learning and memory. Glycine has the potential to make OCD symptoms better.




Myoinositol (MI): It is used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. High amounts of MI have been found in fruits, grains, nuts, and beans.

Social isolation: OCD often leads to self-isolation. Managing obsessions and compulsions can be tiring, which often leads to avoiding other people and potential triggers. Studies show that self-isolation, due to OCD can lead to depression, anxiety, and loneliness.




Difficulty in maintaining relationships: Individuals with OCD are possessive and insecure around romantic relationships leading to doubts, and discomfort. They eventually end up hurting the relationship.




Problems with daily activities: Individuals spend way too much time trying to make or do things right, due to their repetitive nature. This makes it difficult for them to concentrate on work or school.


Suicidal tendency: Studies have shown that individuals with OCD have other co-morbid disorders like depression and anxiety, which can lead to suicidal thoughts and behavior.

",,"Alternative Therapies For Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

Management of OCD requires continuous efforts. Along with CBT and medications, there are a few alternative therapies that have shown promising results. They include:
1. Mindfulness
It involves making a special effort to give your full attention to what is happening in the present moment, to what’s happening in your body, your mind, or your surroundings. Studies show that practicing mindfulness along with CBT and medications can help manage mild to moderate cases of OCD. 
2. Hypnotherapy
Hypnotherapy is a type of complementary therapy that uses hypnosis, which is an altered state of consciousness. Hypnosis is widely promoted as a treatment for anxiety, however, it may not be the best option for the treatment of OCD.
3. Cognitive analytic therapy (CAT)
CAT focuses on an individual's relationships. It is used in individuals living with depression, anxiety, or eating problems, who tend to self-harm, and with personal or relationship problems. CAT may help someone with OCD, but only to a certain extent.
4. Eye movement desensitization 
This is a newer form of therapy that specifically focuses to help people with difficult traumatic memories. EMDR combines talking to a therapist about traumatic experiences with a technique where you make rapid rhythmic eye movements while recalling traumatic events to help you process them. Individuals with OCD can be considered for this therapy if they do not respond to CBT. 
5. Interpersonal therapy (IPT)
This therapy focuses on relationships with other people and how your thoughts, feelings, and behavior are affected by your relationships. However, there is little evidence that this therapy can work for individuals with OCD. 
6. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)
This therapy is an extension of CBT, that helps individuals experiencing borderline personality disorder. At this time there is little evidence to suggest it can help treat OCD any more than CBT. 
7. Emotional freedom technique (EFT)
This therapy is commonly known as psychological acupressure, which aims to release emotional blockages within the body’s energy system. ","Living With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

Oral cancer if caught early has a high probability of survival. Know more about the early warning signs.Read This","Types Of Oral Cancer

There are multiple types of oral cancer and are generally categorized by the type of cell cancer (carcinoma) starts to grow in. They include:
1. Squamous cell carcinoma
This is the most common type of mouth cancer. The earliest form of squamous cell cancer is called carcinoma in situ. This means that the cancer cells are only in the top layer of cells lining cells.
2. Adenocarcinoma
Is a cancer that develops inside the tissue of the salivary gland, which grows from abnormalities in bone, cartilage, muscle, or other tissue cancer that starts in the cells that produce skin pigment or color (melanocytes). 
3. HPV-related cancers
Infection with certain high-risk types of the human papillomavirus (HPV) causes most of the squamous cell cancers of the oropharynx (called HPV-positive cancer). HPV is rarely associated with oral cavity cancer. 
4. Verrucous carcinoma
This is a rare type of squamous cell cancer that is most often found in the gums and cheeks. It's slow-growing cancer that hardly ever spreads to other parts of the body.
5. Other types of oral cavity cancers


Minor salivary gland cancers: These can start in the glands in the mouth and throat lining. 

Lymphomas: The tonsils and base of the tongue contain immune system (lymphoid) tissue, where cancers called lymphomas can start.

Leukoplakia and erythroplakia: These are possible precancerous conditions where certain types of tissue changes can be seen in the mouth or throat.

6. Benign (not cancer) tumors
Many types of benign tumors and tumor-like changes can start in the mouth or throat, such as these:


Peripheral giant cell granuloma: Is the most common oral giant cell lesion appearing as a soft tissue purplish-red nodule.

Fibroma: These are tumors made up of fibrous tissue that can occur almost anywhere in and on the body.

Granular cell tumor: A rare type of soft tissue tumor that usually begins in the cells that hold nerve cells in place.

Schwannoma: A rare type of tumor that forms in the nervous system.

Neurofibroma: A type of nerve tumor that forms soft bumps on or under the skin. 

Pyogenic granuloma: It is a noncancerous, raised tumor on your skin or mucous membranes.

Oral hemangioma: These are benign tumors that develop due to the proliferation of the inner layers of cells around the oral cavity.
",,"Risk Factors For Oral Cancer

Oral cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and is associated with several risk factors. They include:
A. Modifiable factors


Tobacco: Using tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, and snuff, is the single largest risk factor for head and neck cancer and is associated with 85% of head and neck cancers.





Betel quid: Studies have demonstrated that chewing is not only to be a risk factor for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) but also can cause other cancers and adverse health effects.





Alcohol: Alcohol has been implicated in the development of oral cancer. Alcoholic beverages have been considered carcinogenic to humans causing, in particular, tumors of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and liver.





Diet and nutrition: The relationship between diet and nutrition to the risk of cancer development has been established by several epidemiological and laboratory studies.





Mouthwash: The use of mouthwash has also been implicated to cause oral cancer. Mouthwashes usually contain alcohol as a solvent for other ingredients or as a preservative that increases the risk of causing oral cancer.





Maté: It is a tea‑like beverage and has been shown to be an independent cause of the development of oral and pharyngeal cancers.





Poor dental status: Like sharp/fractured teeth due to caries/trauma, and chronic ulceration from an ill‑fitting denture have been suggested to promote cancer in the presence of other risk factors like smoking and alcohol consumption.


B. Non- modifiable factors


Family history: Genetic predisposition has been shown to be an important risk factor in the development of oral cancer. 





Gender: Men are more likely to develop oral and oropharyngeal cancers than women.





Fair skin: Fair skin is linked to a higher risk of lip cancer.





Age: This type of cancer can develop in people of any age, but is seen more in individuals older than 45 years who have an increased risk for oral cancer.



Want to find out if you are at risk of developing cancer? Well, there is a test for that called geneCORE predict – hereditary cancer risk test. This test predicts your risk of up to 22 major cancers. Know More
C. Environmental factors


Viral infections: Studies have shown that Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has been associated as a risk factor in oral cancer, especially HPV type 16. Other oncogenic virus species i.e., Epstein-Barr Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 have been proposed to be involved in oral cancers.




Fungal infections: Fungal infections caused by Candida species, in particular, Candida albicans have been implicated in the pathogenesis of oral precancerous lesions that have higher chances of developing into cancer.




Prolonged sun exposure: High exposure to the sun, without sun protection measures, is linked with cancer in the lip area. 




Syphilis: Tertiary syphilis has been known to predispose to the development of oral cancer along with other risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol. 




Radiation: Studies have shown a relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the later development of salivary gland tumors. 


Immunosuppression: Individuals whose immune system is compromised due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), transplant, and other disorders are more prone to develop oral cancers.

","Diagnosis Of Oral Cancer
Diagnosing oral cancer at an early stage is the key to a better prognosis. TNM stands for tumor, node, and metastases. It is one of the staging systems doctors use for mouth cancer. It includes:
Primary tumor (T)


TX: Tumor cannot be assessed


T0: No evidence of primary tumor


Tis: Carcinoma in situ (CIS)- a group of abnormal cells that are found only in the place where they first formed in the body


T1: Tumor 2 cm or less in greatest dimension


T2: Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension


T3: Tumor more than 4 cm in greatest dimension


T4a: A moderately advanced local disease. 


T4b: Very advanced local disease.


Regional lymph nodes (N)


NX: Cannot be assessed


N0: No regional lymph node metastasis ( spread of cancer)


N1: Metastasis in a single lymph node on one side (ipsilateral), 3 cm or less in greatest dimension


N2: Metastasis as specified in:


N2a: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, more than 3 cm but not more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.


N2b: Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension


N2c: Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.




N3: Metastasis in a lymph node more than 6 cm in greatest dimension.


Distant metastasis (M)


MX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed


M0: No distant metastasis.



Early detection is the key to a good outcome for any cancer. Read about 8 common signs of cancer that you should look out for.Click NowThe diagnosis consists of the following:
A. Physical examination
The primary and the most crucial assessment for oral cancer is the physical examination, which usually consists of two steps – systematic visual examination and palpation. Primarily, the external parts such as lymph nodes, salivary glands, lips, etc. are inspected, and subsequently, an internal examination of the mouth is performed to look for irregularities, swelling, and thickening.
B. Histopathological examination
Histopathology is used to assess the aggressiveness of tumors with high invasive potential. It includes:


Vital staining techniques: Visual tissue staining is an adjunct technique used in the diagnosis of cancer. Tolonium chloride (also known as toluidine blue) staining is used to detect mucosal abnormalities in the oral cavity. 


Biopsy: A tissue sample is removed surgically from the suspected region and sent to the pathological laboratory for a detailed microscopic examination.


Brush biopsy: In brush biopsy, cells from the oral lesion are obtained by scraping the surface mucosa. 


Exfoliative cytology: Exfoliative cytology is a simple and noninvasive diagnostic technique for the early detection of oral cancer.


Incisional biopsy: In this type of biopsy, a representative sample of the tissue is carefully chosen for selective diagnosis. 


C. Imaging techniques
Several advanced imaging techniques are used for the diagnosis of oral cancer.
 


Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI provides the details of the structures in the oral cavity along with adjacent parts. The soft-tissue discrimination by MRI aids in assessing the extent of local and regional spread of the tumor, invasion depth, and extent of involvement of lymph nodes.


Computed tomography (CT): The CT scan uses x-ray radiations and a computer to create pictures of the body to locate the cancerous lesion and determine its spread to the other parts of the body.


Positron emission tomography (PET): The PET scan is used to determine the spread of tumor cells to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.


Radiological techniques: X-ray is used to determine the spread of cancer to the other organs outside of the mouth and oropharynx. The x-ray done for oral cancer is known as an orthopantomogram (OPG).


Optical imaging techniques: These include optical coherence tomography and tissue fluorescence imaging that can effectively differentiate between cancerous and non-cancerous lesions. 


D. Biomarker detection 
Biomarkers are used for the early detection of oral cancer. Biomarkers in general are components of the cells present in body fluid or tumor cells that are overexpressed during the onset of the disease. 
E. Other methods
In recent years, significant advancements have been reported in diagnostic techniques that are rapid and specific for the detection of cancer biomarkers. They include:


Raman spectroscopy: It is a non-destructive chemical analysis technique that provides detailed information about the chemical structure.


Confocal microscopy: This is another light-based technique that provides images of many important cellular and architectural features of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

The exact cause of oral cancer is unknown and there can be multifactorial causes. The best way of preventing any kind of cancer is to lead a healthy lifestyle. Other things to keep in mind include:
1. Get cancer screening for early detection
Cancers detected at early stages can be treated more successfully. Delay in diagnosis has an effect on cancer-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, screening and early clinical diagnosis help to provide more safe and cheap treatments. 
2. Always self-examine yourself
It is another way to detect oral cancer at an early stage. You can do this by:


Looking at the inside of both of your cheeks with your flashlight


Feeling those areas with your fingers


Checking floor of your mouth (beneath your tongue) with your flashlight


Examining the floor of your mouth with your finger


Sticking out your tongue, examine the top, both sides, and under the surface using your flashlight.


3. Visit your dentist regularly
Seeing your dentist regularly is key to maintaining good oral health. As part of your examination, your dentist can look and feel in and around your mouth and any unusual lumps or sores can be detected early. 
4. Stay away from all forms of tobacco
Chewing, smokeless, and snuff tobacco, which is placed directly in the mouth, can create gray-white ulcers called leukoplakia in the mouth that can become cancerous. Smokeless tobacco also contains chemicals known to damage a gene that protects against cancer.

5. Limit your alcohol intake
Moderate to heavy alcohol consumption is associated with higher risks of certain head and neck cancers, and reducing the intake can be very beneficial.
Note: Avoid the combination of alcohol and tobacco. Research shows that people who use both alcohol and tobacco have much greater risks of developing oral cancer than people who use either alcohol or tobacco alone. Know more about other cancer-related myths and facts.Watch Now
6. Get vaccinated for HPV
Human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV16, is strongly associated with oropharyngeal cancers, especially those at the back of the mouth. The best way to prevent HPV is to get vaccinated before you become sexually active, and also practice safe sex.

Speak to an expert doctor to find out how you can reduce these risks of developing oral cancer.Book Consultation Here","Treatment Of Oral Cancer
Any kind of cancer requires multidisciplinary treatment that includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, alone or in combination. Oral cancer treatment includes:
A. Surgical management 


Surgery for primary tumors: Surgery is recommended for patients with early-stage tumors and surgery or definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for those with advanced-staged tumors. Approaches to the removal of the tumor and the surrounding structures are dictated by the location and extent of invasion.




Surgery for neck dissection: Neck dissection detects any spread of cancer in the early stage and removes the majority of affected lymph nodes. In patients with early-stage tumors, the decision to proceed to elective neck dissection (END) is based on a greater than 20% probability of the presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes. Alternatives to END include


Observation


Elective radiation


Sentinel lymph node biopsy






Other surgeries:


Glossectomy (partial or total removal of your tongue)


Mandibulectomy (surgery for oral cancer in your jawbone)


Maxillectomy (removal of a part or all of the bony roof of your mouth).




Surgery in case of recurrence
Recurrence rates in the oral cavity is 30%, and Salvage (or 'rescue') surgery is used to refer to surgical treatment after failure of initial treatment in various scenarios including treatment of delayed neck metastasis, recurrent primary tumors, or even spread of cancer to the lungs.
Reconstruction
The oral cavity is a complex site made up of several structures critical for speech, swallowing, and appearance. To be deemed successful, reconstruction should attempt to address all three, and it must be tailored to the site of the defect. 
Radiation
Radiation therapy uses X-rays to destroy or damage cancer cells, making them unable to proliferate. Radiotherapy is mainly used in patients with locally advanced oral cancer.
Although definitive radiation therapy can be used for oral cancer, it is not routinely used because of elevated rates of Osteoradionecrosis (bone death due to necrosis) associated with the higher therapeutic doses required compared with doses for postoperative adjuvant therapy. Types of radiation therapy include:


External-beam radiation therapy: The most common type of radiation in which the radiation is given from a machine outside the body. 




Internal-beam radiation therapy: When radiation treatment is given using implants, it is called internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy. Brachytherapy involves the application of a radioactive source in close proximity to the tumor. 


Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy (chemo) is treatment with anti-cancer drugs that are injected into a vein or taken by mouth, which allows them to enter the blood and reach most parts of the body. Drugs used for chemotherapy include:


Cisplatin


Carboplatin


5-fluorouracil (5-FU)


Paclitaxel (Taxol)


Docetaxel (Taxotere)


Hydroxyurea


Other less often used drugs include:


Methotrexate


Capecitabine


Types of chemotherapy include:


Adjuvant chemotherapy: It is given after surgery and is sometimes combined with radiation therapy. The goal is to kill cancer cells that might have been left behind at surgery because of the smaller size and also prevents recurrence.




Neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy: This is given before surgery with or without radiation to shrink some larger cancers to make surgery easier and remove less tissue. This can lead to fewer serious side effects and problems from surgery.



Note: For advanced cancer, chemo (with or without radiation therapy) can be used to treat cancers that are too large or have spread too far to be removed by surgery. The goal is to slow the growth of cancer.
Chemoradiation
Chemoradiation is chemotherapy given at the same time as radiation. It has been shown to shrink oral cavity and oropharyngeal tumors that are not widespread but are too advanced for surgery. Generally, this approach is hard to tolerate, especially for people in poor health.
Targeted therapy
It is the use of medicines that target or are directed at proteins in cancer cells by destroying cancer cells or slowing their growth. Some targeted drugs, for example, monoclonal antibodies, work in more than one way to control cancer cells and may also be considered immunotherapy because they boost the immune system. Cetuximab is the most commonly used drug for this therapy.
Immunotherapy
This therapy uses medicines to help boost a person’s own immune system to find and destroy cancer cells more effectively. It typically works on specific proteins involved in the immune system to enhance the immune response.
B. Non-surgical management
This type of management is used to preserve the organs, although surgery is the mainstay of therapy for advanced-stage oral cancer.

",,"Types of Oral Thrush
Oral thrush can be classified into the following:
Primary oral candidiasis (Group I)
Acute


Pseudomembranous: It is the most common type and is in newborns and immunocompromised patients, and elderly people. 

Erythematous: It manifests as a painful localized red area. This type is seen more commonly in HIV patients.

Chronic


Erythematous: Also known as “denture stomatitis”, is a chronic inflammation of the mouth underlying a partial or total denture.

Pseudomembranous: This is characterized by extensive white patches that occur on the mouth, tongue, and throat.

Angular cheilitis: This a variant of oral candidiasis that classically presents as a white patch on the corners of the mouth and has the potential to evolve into cancer.

Median rhomboid glossitis: It is a very rare type of oral candidiasis that presents as a rhomboid-shaped erythematous patch in the center of the tongue.

Linear gingival erythema: Typically seen in HIV patients and clinically presents as an erythematous (red) line or band over the gums of one or more teeth.

Secondary oral candidiasis (Group II)
Candidiasis due to diseases such as 


Thymic aplasia: It is genetic with decreased T-cell receptors compromising immunity. 

Candidiasis endocrinopathy syndrome: It is a group of disorders characterized by recurrent or persistent superficial infections of the skin, tissue layers, and nails.
","Risk Factors For Oral Thrush

Though oral thrush is not a life-threatening condition, it is quite common and can have an effect on general well-being. Various risk factors of oral thrush include:
Local factors
1. Saliva: Salivary gland dysfunction predisposes to oral candidiasis. Conditions affecting the quantity (like xerostomia) and quality of salivary secretions may lead to an increased risk of oral thrush.2. Dentures: They create a favorable environment for candida organisms to thrive. The majority of the people wearing complete dentures are predisposed to candida infection. 3. Topical medications: The use of topical or inhalational corticosteroids and overzealous use of antimicrobial mouthwashes can temporarily suppress local immunity and cause alterations in the oral flora, thereby increasing the risk of candidiasis.4. Smoking:  Studies suggest that smoking alone or in combination with other factors, significantly affects the oral candida environment in the mouth.Want to quit smoking? Try our smoking cessation range to help you get rid of this unhealthy habit.Shop Now5. Poor oral hygiene: The presence of deposits and tartar on the teeth and adjoining gums increases the risk of developing oral thrush.

Diet: Excessive intake of refined sugars, carbohydrates, and dairy products can enhance the growth of candida organisms by reducing the pH levels.Want to know more about healthy eating habits?
Systemic factors
1. Age: Extremes of age, like infancy or old age, may predispose to oral thrush due to immature or weakened immunity.2. Malnutrition: The deficiency of iron, essential fatty acids, folic acid, vitamins A and B6, magnesium, selenium, and zinc can help in the overgrowth of the candida species. 3. Medications: Prolonged use of drugs like broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppressants that cause dry mouth (xerostomia) create a favorable environment for candida to grow.4. Endocrine disorders: A more aggressive form of oral thrush is more prevalent in patients with endocrine dysfunctions such as diabetes and Cushing’s syndrome (a noncancerous benign tumor of the pituitary gland).5. Immunodeficiency: Conditions such as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome (SCID) that severely affect immunity are significant predisposing factors for candidiasis.6. Cancer: The host defense mechanisms are compromised by chemotherapy and radiotherapy administered for the treatment of cancer. This significantly reduces immunity and leads to oral thrush.7. Congenital conditions: Individuals affected by congenital conditions associated with the defective immune system are commonly predisposed to candida infections.","Diagnosis Of Oral thrush
Oral thrush is easily noticeable as a white patch in and around the mouth. To confirm the diagnosis or to rule out any other underlying health conditions your doctor will include:
Physical examination
To diagnose oral thrush, your doctor or dentist may examine your mouth to look at the lesions, where they are located, and if they are scrapable or not.
Blood tests
Your doctor may sometimes suggest a blood test to look for certain conditions that may make you more likely to develop an oral thrush such as a deficiency of iron, vitamin B12, or folic acid.
Laboratory tests
1. Histopathology examination: This consists of taking a small scraping of the active lesions to examine under a microscope. 2. Biopsy: Biopsy specimens should in addition be sent for histopathological examination when chronic hyperplastic candidosis is suspected.3. Impression culture technique: Taking an impression of both the upper and lower jaw, to estimate the growth of the candida organisms.4. Saliva collection: This simple technique involves taking the saliva of patients who show clinical signs of oral thrush.5. Paper points test: An absorbable sterile point is inserted to the depth of the pocket and kept there for 10 sec. It is then treated with a solution to check for any growth.

","Symptoms Of Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis is common as age advances. Individuals above the age of 60 have significant wear and tear in their joints, leading to the development of osteoarthritis. The following symptoms are commonly seen with osteoarthritis -
Knee Osteoarthritis


Chronic pain, tenderness, swelling in the knee joint


Reduced range of motion, stiffness in the knee joint


Crepitus or abnormal grinding sounds heard on joint movement


Bone spurs, which are extra bits of bone, which feel like hard lumps, can form around the affected joint.


Bone deformity


Hip Osteoarthritis


Chronic pain, tenderness, swelling in the hip joint


Reduced range of motion, stiffness in the hip joint


Crepitus or abnormal grinding sounds heard on joint movement


Joint deformity


Cervical Spondylosis (Osteoarthritis)


Pain and stiffness of the neck


Radiating or sharp shooting pain in the upper limbs


Tingling and/or numbness in the upper limbs


Dizziness


Vertigo


Grinding noise in the neck when the neck is turned sideways


Lumbar Spondylosis (Osteoarthritis)


Pain and stiffness of the lower back


Radiating or sharp shooting pain in the lower limbs and buttocks


Tingling and/or numbness in the lower limbs


Inability to stand or walk for longer durations


Balance problems

","Causes Of Osteoarthritis

A lot of factors are responsible for osteoarthritis, such as:
Age-related degenerative changes
With increasing age, there is normal wear and tear of the joints, cartilages, ligaments, and other soft tissues in the body. These degenerative changes occur in various joints making them stiff. Degeneration of the joints also leads to formation of osteophytes which are extra bony protrusions and are characteristic to osteoarthritic joints. These can lead to immense pain and stiffness. In advanced stages, joint deformities occur that can severely impact function and mobility.

Heredity
Genetic factors likely influence the formation of osteophytes and degeneration of joints. This is likely attributed to polymorphism in genes regulating the inflammatory pathways. For example, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is characterized by joint hypermobility, can contribute to osteoarthritis.

Environmental factors
A poor posture, lack of exercise, obesity, occupational hazards, such as lifting heavy weights, previous trauma to the joints cause faster wear and tear of the joints, leading to osteoarthritis.

Post menopause
Decreased estrogen as experienced by post-menopausal women increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis as estrogen is protective of bone health specifically reducing oxidative stress to the cartilage.","Risk Factors For Osteoarthritis

Certain risk factors may predispose an individual to develop osteoarthritis:


Age more than 50 years


Obesity/overweight


Diabetes


Elevated cholesterol levels


Hypothyroidism


Hyperparathyroidism 


Acromegaly


Paget’s disease


Wilson disease


History of trauma to the joints


Faulty alignment of the joints


Occupational overuse of a joint. eg. athletes or people using hand drills


Improper weight-bearing


History of heavy weight lifting


Poor posture


Lack of exercise

",,"Specialist To Visit

When symptoms of joint pain start to become bothersome, it is essential to visit an orthopedic doctor who will diagnose and treat the condition. Other doctors, such as neurologists, physiotherapists, help with the management of troublesome symptoms of osteoarthritis. The doctors to visit for osteoarthritis are -


Orthopedician - specialises in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system


Physiotherapist - for corrective exercises to increase strength and mobility in the joints and reduce pain


Neurologist - to manage the complications arising from osteoarthritis of the spine, such as tingling, numbness in the upper or lower limbs, weakness of upper or lower limbs, vertigo, headaches

","Home Care For Osteoarthritis

Along with the medications, following home care tips can help manage symptoms and lead to the best possible disease outcomes:


Take a wholesome, balanced diet rich in calcium and other minerals.


Follow the exercise routine suggested by the doctor or physiotherapist.


Hot fomentation and application of topical analgesic preparations help relieve pain and stiffness. 


Intermittent hot and cold treatments may provide temporary relief of pain and stiffness. Such treatments include a hot shower or bath and the careful application of heating or cooling pads or packs.


Gentle massage performed by a massage therapist can provide relaxation and promote pain relief. 


Use joint supports, such as knee caps, cervical collar, lumbosacral belt to help support the spine.


Walking aids, such as a cane or walker, may help offload the diseased joints and promote safer walking and offer pain relief.


Avoid lifting heavyweights, and if done as a part of an exercise program, it must be done with extreme caution and correct ergonomic posture.


Change the mattress and sleeping pillow if not proper, and use the ones that offer good support and stabilize the spine.


Properly position and support your neck and back while sitting or sleeping. 


Adjust furniture such as raising a chair or adjust your toilet seat to prevent pressure on the joints.


Avoid repeated motions of the joint, especially frequent bending.

","Complications Of Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis is a disease that progresses with age. If enough care is not taken during the early stages of osteoarthritis, the following complications can occur:


A complete loss of mobility and extreme stiffness in the joints, rendering a patient bedridden or with severe walking issues.


Chronic debilitating pain that may interfere with sleep and be a source of anxiety or depression.


Neurological complications, such as paralysis, nerve pain, may occur as a result of advanced spondylosis.

","Alternative Therapies Of Osteoarthritis

Along with medicines and topical analgesic preparations, various other treatment options help in the management of osteoarthritis:
Exercise and Yoga
Regular exercises and yoga focused on strengthening the joints and surrounding musculature and improving mobility are very helpful in managing the pain and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis.
Massage
A gentle massage improves blood flow in the affected parts, promotes relaxation, and helps with pain relief. Massages must be performed only by a qualified massage therapist.
Physiotherapy
Physiotherapeutic modalities, such as Interferential Therapy (IFT) and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), are very useful in offering pain relief even from nerve pain. The rehabilitation exercises focus on strengthening and correcting weight-bearing of the joint and surrounding muscles, improving the overall strength and mobility of the affected joints.
Acupressure and Acupuncture
Chronic joint pain may respond to acupuncture or acupressure therapy, an alternative form of therapy that works by applying pressure or noxious stimuli on the peripheral trigger points.
Ayurveda
There are various Ayurvedic preparations in the form of oils and liniments. These are usually applied locally at the site of pain. They provide good relief from symptoms and promote joint health. Click here to know more about Ayurvedic remedies for knee pain.
Homeopathy
Homeopathic preparations in the form of injections or oral drops/pills, such as Rhus Toxicodendron, Arnica Montana, Solanum Dulcamara, etc., are known to improve pain and other troublesome symptoms of patients with osteoarthritis.
External Orthoses Support
Using knee caps, cervical collars, lumbosacral belts, and walking aids like a stick or walker offer much-needed support to the degenerative joints and are useful in alleviating pain due to osteoarthritis.","Living With Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis has a great impact on an individual’s quality of life. Severe, chronic, and debilitating pain may interfere with basic activities, such as walking, leading to restrictions in movements and travel. Often, chronic pain is a source of anxiety and depression in osteoarthritic patients, and they find themselves withdrawn from society and the community at large. Joining knee care and spine care clubs may help these patients deal with the degenerative changes and bond with others suffering similar pain.
Here are a few lifestyle changes one can incorporate into their routine life to ease off joint pains, especially during winter.
1. Supplement bone & joint healthy foods


Stock up dairy products and spend at least 15 minutes in sunlight daily to increase the intake of vitamin D. 


Include foods rich in omega-3 fats such as salmon, nuts, fish oil in your diet as these ease inflammation. 


Foods rich in vitamin K are helpful because of its pain-soothing properties. Include greens in your meal such as spinach, fenugreek (methi), cabbage, kale, etc.


Foods rich in vitamin C halt cartilage loss associated with arthritis. Add juicy oranges, sweet red peppers, tomatoes, amla and other vitamin C-rich foods in your diet.


2. Exercise regularly
Go for a 30-minute walk daily. If cold weather makes you lazy to go out in the mornings, go for an afternoon walk. Also, stretch your muscles as it helps maintain your mobility.

3. Stay hydrated
Drink plenty of water in winters as dehydration reduces flexibility and increases stiffness.

4. Get a massage
Massage therapy by a professional helps in relaxing the muscles around the painful joints, thereby reducing pain and making you more mobile.

5. Cover Up
Try to keep painful joints covered with a sleeve or wrap. Keeping them warm helps reduce pain and increases mobility. Using a muscle relaxant gel on the aching joints and then covering up has been seen to be very helpful.

6. Use hot packs/ice packs
Hot packs/hot baths/steam helps to soothe the painful joints. Heat stimulates blood flow, which brings healing nutrients to the affected area and inhibits the pain messages being sent to the brain.

7. Take medication on time
Do not forget to take your medications as advised by your doctor. If you suffer from chronic joint pain, consult your doctor for painkillers. Do not self-medicate. Also, go for regular doctor consultation, especially if your symptoms recur/worsen.

","Symptoms Of Palpitations
It is important to understand that heart palpitations are a symptom of a condition or a state of the body and not a medical disease in itself. Palpitations are sensations that make a person feel like their heart is pounding or racing. One can feel heart palpitations in the throat or neck too. The symptoms of heart palpitations include the following:


Being unpleasantly aware of your own heartbeat


Feeling like your heart has skipped a beat or stopped beats 


Heart is fluttering rapidly 


Pounding heartbeat 


Flip-flopping of heat beat 


Aditionally, symptoms that can be associated with palpitations are:


Shortness of breath 


Chest pain 


Fainting 


Dizziness 


Headache


Sweating


Palpitation associated with chest pain suggests coronary artery disease, or if the chest pain is relieved by leaning forward, pericardial disease is suspected. Palpitation associated with light-headedness, fainting or near fainting suggest low blood pressure and may signify a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm. If a benign cause for these concerning symptoms cannot be found at the initial visit, then ambulatory monitoring or prolonged heart monitoring in the hospital might be warranted. Noncardiac symptoms should also be elicited since the palpitations may be caused by a normal heart responding to a metabolic or inflammatory condition. Weight loss suggests hyperthyroidism. Palpitation can be precipitated by vomiting or diarrhea that leads to electrolyte disorders and hypovolemia. Hyperventilation, hand tingling, and nervousness are common when anxiety or panic disorder is the cause of the palpitations.","Causes Of Palpitations
Some common causes of palpitations include the following:


Experiencing powerful emotional reactions such as stress, anxiety or panic attacks.




A difficult workout 




Undergoing mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety disorder




Drinking excessive amounts of food products containing stimulants such as coffee or tea. 




Medications that contain nicotine, amphetamines, cold and cough medications containing pseudoephedrine, asthma inhalers and withdrawal from beta blockers.




Experiencing hormonal changes during menstruation or pregnancy




Too much or too little thyroid hormones. 




Taking diet pills 




Fever 




Low level of oxygen in the blood 




Blood loss




Low blood sugar 


Sometimes, palpitations can be caused because of an abnormal heartbeat that can be caused due to the following medical conditions:

Abnormal heart valve 

Conditions such as a mitral valve prolapse affects the flaps or leaflets of the heart that play important roles in the pumping of blood through the heart. The mitral valve is present between the left heart chambers and normally bulges into the hearts upper left chamber when the heart contracts. A defect or a disease that affects the mitral valve can result in an abnormal heartbeat. 

Heart arrhythmia

Palpitations can be caused by certain conditions that can cause arrhythmia (problem with the rhythm of the heart). Some common heart arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, a condition in which the heart beats irregularly and at a faster pace than normal. Atrial flutter causes a fast and irregular heartbeat and Supraventricular tachycardia results in an abnormally fast heart rate. 
Abnormal level of potassium 
Potassium is a key nutrient that plays an important role in influencing the heart rate. If a person has low levels of potassium they can experience an irregular heartbeat that is known as heart arrhythmia. Excessive levels of potassium can also lead to irregular heartbeat and a person may experience a fluttering sensation in the chest. This results in palpitations and can indicate a serious heart condition that would need professional medical advice. 
Heart diseases 
Heart conditions such as congenital heart defects (heart problems that develop when a foetus is growing), coronary heart disease (a condition that causes plaque buildup in the arteries responsible for moving oxygenated blood through the body) and cardiomyopathy (a condition that causes the muscle of the heart to grow thick or weak) can cause palpitations. 

Congestive heart failure 
Congestive heart failure or CHF affects the pumping ability of the heart and is often referred to as heart failure. This condition results in a stage where the fluids within the heart build up and results in inefficient pumping of blood. This condition can result in palpitations and irregular heartbeat. 
Other medical conditions
Sleep apnea: A condition that is caused by the continuous repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep. It is one of the most common breathing-related disorders. Anemia: A condition that occurs due to decreased number of healthy red blood cells in the body resulting in an insufficient supply of oxygen to the body. This can result in palpitations, fatigue and shortness of breath. Metabolic conditions: There are many metabolic conditions that can result in palpitations including, hyperthyroidism, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hypomagnesemia, and pheochromocytomaOther etiologies also include excess caffeine, or marijuana. Cocaine, amphetamines, 3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy or MDMA) can also cause palpitations.","Risk Factors For Palpitations
Some common risk factors of palpitations include the following:


Pregnancy 


Stress


An overactive thyroid 


Taking medications for cold or asthma 


Anxiety or panic disorder


Irregular heartbeats 


Previous heart surgery or structural heart changes 

",,"Specialist To Visit
You should visit a doctor if you are experiencing symptoms such as loss of consciousness, chest pain, unusual sweating, dizziness, lightheadedness, experiencing more heartbeats frequently, pulse more than 100 per minute, shortness of breath and history of cardiac problems or if the palpitations lasts a longer time or gets worsen .

Stick to the right treatment plan, as decided by your doctor, and incorporating the necessary lifestyle changes can help you take care of your condition and recover faster.

",,"Complications Of Palpitations

Palpitations that do not resolve on their own and are caused by medical conditions can cause certain complications if left untreated. This includes the following:

Fainting 
One can experience loss of consciousness if the heart beats too rapidly leading to a drop in the blood pressure. The risk of the same increases in people who are suffering from congenital heart conditions or specific heart valve problems. 

Cardiac arrest 
Sometimes palpitations can be caused due to life-threatening heartbeat problems that can result in the heart stopping beating effectively. 

Stroke 
If the palpitations are caused by a condition that affects the upper chambers of the heart resulting in the heart beating to quiver instead of beating regularly, stroke can occur. This is caused due to pooling of blood that causes clots to form, if a clot breaks it can occlude a brain artery and result in a stroke that can be life-threatening. 

Heart failure
Specific arrhythmias can effectively reduce a heart's capacity to pump blood through the body. Heart function can be improved by controlling the rate of an arrhythmia that's causing heart failure. ","Alternative Therapies For Palpitations
If you have palpitations, these therapies can help you control the condition. They are:

Exercising 

Leading a healthy lifestyle and doing light exercises daily such as walking can help in managing your medical condition. Talk to your doctor about what kind of exercises would suit your condition.

Diet changes 

Choose a diet that is low on unhealthy carbs and follow protein guidelines given by your doctor. The guidelines of what you are supposed to eat will depend on the severity of the condition and the treatment regimen that you are on. It is important to follow the advice of your doctor since your diet influences your health.

Yoga 

Opting for simple exercises such as yoga can help you avoid stress and anxiety that can further help your health.","Living With Palpitations
Experiencing palpitations can be scary and can cause difficulty in carrying out day to day tasks. However, modern science has opened the doors to several possibilities that can allow you to live a healthy life and prevent the occurrence of irregular heart rhythms. Along with your medical treatments, it is important to incorporate lifestyle changes that will help you cope with your condition. Here are a few tips that you can follow:

Follow up with your doctor
Make sure that you stay in touch with your doctor and report any changes in your palpitations or if you keep regularly experiencing heart palpitations. Call your doctor if you experience any sudden change in the nature of your palpitations or feel that you are losing consciousness. 

Follow a healthy lifestyle 
Incorporate the changes recommended to you by your doctor. You may be advised to exercise regularly and eat a balanced diet that incorporates fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 

Take your medications regularly 
If you have been given medications to regulate arrhythmia, take the medicines regularly and follow up with your doctor about any change in your condition

","Symptoms Of Pancreatic Cancer
Most people don’t experience early signs of pancreatic cancer. The doctor may suspect pancreatic cancer if the patient has recently developed diabetes or pancreatitis (a painful condition due to the inflammation of the pancreas). As the disease progresses, people may notice symptoms like:


Pain in the upper abdomen, radiating to the back


Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes)


Tiredness and fatigue


Loss of appetite


Light-colored stools


Dark-colored urine


Loss of weight


Formation of blood clots in the body


Dry and itchy skin


Worsening diabetes or a new diagnosis


Nausea and vomiting


Some symptoms of pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer may be different from the traditional pancreatic cancer symptoms because some PNETs overproduce hormones. These symptoms include:


Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (in which the stomach makes too much acid) causing stomach ulcers


Irritations on the tongue and corners of the mouth


Malnutrition


Shortness of breath


Rashes or blisters on the skin


Excessive thirst

Pancreatic tumors are either exocrine or neuroendocrine (endocrine) tumors based on the type of cell they start in. Every pancreatic cancer patient is different and the treatment is based on the type. Types of pancreatic cancer are:

Exocrine pancreatic cancer

Most of the pancreatic tumors are exocrine tumors (about 93 percent). They start in the exocrine cells (that produce enzymes for digestion) of the pancreas and include:Adenocarcinoma: The most common type of pancreatic cancer is adenocarcinoma (9 out of 10 cases of pancreatic cancer). It is an exocrine tumor that starts in the cells lining the pancreatic duct, which make enzymes for digestion.


Mucinous cystic neoplasm: This is an invasive adenocarcinoma and is a cyst filled with thick fluid. Mucinous cystic neoplasms can be non-cancerous (benign) if they are not invasive.


Other rare exocrine tumors include:


Squamous cell carcinoma: This extremely and forms in the pancreatic ducts, and is made purely of squamous cells, which are not typically seen in the pancreas.


Adenosquamous carcinoma: This rarest type of pancreatic cancer (1-4 percent). It is a more aggressive tumor with a poorer prognosis.


Colloid carcinoma: These tumors are very rare and tend to develop from a type of benign cyst called an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).


Neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer
Neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs or PNETs) are rare (about 7 percent). They often grow slower than exocrine tumors. PNETs come from the abnormal growth of endocrine cells in the pancreas called islet cells, responsible for controlling blood sugar levels (hence they are also called islet cell tumors).PNETs are classified by the hormones they make and common types include:


Gastrinoma: A gastrin-producing tumor usually located in the pancreas or the duodenal wall. Gastrin is a peptide hormone that stimulates the secretion of gastric acid.


Glucagonoma: Glucagonoma is a very rare tumor of the islet cells of the pancreas, which leads to an excess of the hormone glucagon in the blood.


Insulinoma: Pancreatic tumor that leads to extra insulin production causing hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).


Somatostatinoma: They start in neuroendocrine cells that make the hormone somatostatin.


VIPoma: A non-beta pancreatic islet cell tumor secreting vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), resulting in a syndrome of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (absence of hydrochloric acid in gastric secretions).


Nonfunctional islet cell tumor: Tumor arising from the pancreatic islet cell that is rare and no hormone is involved.


Note: Benign precancerous lesions are cysts and other benign tumors in the pancreas and can be precursors to pancreatic cancer, including intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).","Causes Of Pancreatic Cancer

The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown.Pancreatic cancer occurs when abnormal cells begin to grow within the pancreas. These abnormal cells develop because of changes (mutations) in their DNA. This mutated DNA dictates the cells to grow uncontrollably and to continue living after normal cells die. These masses of cells can form a tumor. When left untreated, these cells continue to grow out of control and metastasize (spread to other parts of the body). Anyone can get pancreatic cancer. Though it's not always clear what causes it, research has identified some of the risk factors that can lead to it.",,"Prevention Of Pancreatic Cancer
Cancer prevention is an action taken to lower the chance of getting cancer. Many things in our genes, our lifestyle, and the environment around us may increase or decrease our risk of getting cancer. Some of the ways to prevent pancreatic cancer include:


Avoiding or controlling things known to cause cancer


Changing diet and adopting a healthy lifestyle


Finding precancerous conditions at an early stage


Taking medicines to treat a precancerous condition or to keep cancer from starting (chemoprevention)


Planning risk-reducing surgery


Avoiding tobacco smoking


Reducing alcohol consumption


Minimizing risk factors associated with chronic pancreatitis


Individuals with a high-risk genetic background may require:


Counseling


Genetic testing if appropriate (BRCA2 mutation or p16INK4A inactivity) 


Secondary screening for pancreatic cancer

Pancreatic cancer requires multidisciplinary treatment and requires surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, alone or in combination.

Surgical management

Surgical treatment is considered the best way to cure pancreatic cancer as it can significantly prolong survival. The surgical procedures include:1. Pancreatectomy
It consists of the Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy), which is an operation to remove the head of the pancreas. Along with this, the distal or total pancreatectomy (removal of the pancreas) is the best surgical option for the resection of pancreatic cancer depending on the anatomical location of the tumor or tumors. It requires:


Preoperative biliary drainage: A significant proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer present with jaundice and pre-operative drainage relieves the obstruction and may reverse the pathophysiological dysfunction caused by obstructive jaundice.


Anastomotic technique: A major source of death following Whipple’s procedure is a leak from pancreatic anastomosis and the formation of a pancreatic fistula. It consists of anastomosing (suturing) the pancreatic duct to the jejunum (middle part of the small intestine) or stomach.


2. Laparoscopic surgery
Laparoscopy is a type of surgical procedure that allows a surgeon to access the inside of the abdomen (tummy) and pelvis without having to make large incisions in the skin. This minimally invasive surgery requires laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for the resection. There was no difference in the rate of positive resection margins and outcomes.3. Vascular resection
The relationship between any pancreatic tumor and the surrounding vasculature is an important determinant of how much resection needs to be done. Pancreatic cancer resection includes total pancreatectomy, distal pancreatectomy plus splenectomy (removal of the spleen). 

Medical management

1. Adjuvant chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is an important part of the comprehensive treatment of pancreatic cancer. The overall survival rate after radical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy improves in most cases. Generally, used chemotherapy regimens after radical resection are:


Modified leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (MFOLFIRINOX) for 6 months 


Gemcitabine and capecitabine combined for 6 months 


Folfirinox regimen, gemcitabine, and Pac-Nab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastasis (spread of cancer to other organs)


Gemcitabine is the first choice if the patient is not suitable for combination chemotherapy


Gemcitabine (with or without erlotinib) combined with 54 Gy (radiation dose) is used for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer


2. Neoadjuvant treatment
It is treatment given as a first step to shrink a tumor before the main treatment, which is usually surgery since a relapse of symptoms is usually seen in 71% and 76% percent of patients within two years. Furthermore, due to complications associated with surgery up to 40% of patients are not suitable for progression to adjuvant therapy. A good success rate with neoadjuvant treatment in several other cancers including rectal, oesophageal, and gastric cancer have led to the exploration of the impact of neoadjuvant treatment in pancreatic cancer as well. 
Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy uses X-rays to destroy or damage cancer cells, making them unable to proliferate. Radiotherapy is mainly used in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. It uses:


External beam radiation therapy: This uses external radiation therapy sources that emit X-rays, gamma rays, electrons or heavy particles. 


Brachytherapy: It is a type of internal radiation therapy in which seeds, ribbons, or capsules that contain a radiation source are placed inside the body, or near the tumors. It is mainly used for internal radiotherapy by surgery or laparoscopy in the pancreas or adjacent to the pancreas.


Targeted therapy
This is very successful in many types of cancer, though, to date, all other targeted drugs have failed in pancreatic cancer patients, including affrecept, cetuximab, sorafenib, bevacizumab, and axitinib. Recently the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab as a targeted treatment for pancreatic cancer.

A lot of research and studies on the latest treatment options are going on. Some of them are:


Gene therapy: Gene therapy is the delivery of specific genes to cancer cells, which are often carried by specially designed viruses. 


Cancer stem cells: Research is currently focused on identifying treatments that may specifically target the pancreatic cancer stem cells.


Genetic/molecular studies: Many new research developments are based on identifying damaged genes and proteins and repairing them or changing how they work.


Circulating tumor (ct)DNA: The ctDNA is being studied as a tool for monitoring response to treatment, for observing early signs of disease recurrence, and as a way to determine the disease's resistance to the ongoing treatment.


Other treatment modalities
Patients with pancreatic cancer need palliative care at some point, it is as important as other treatments themselves. Some of the procedures done for the management of patients with gastric outlet obstruction include:


Percutaneous bile duct drainage: A procedure to drain bile to relieve pressure in the bile ducts caused by a blockage.


Surgical gastrojejunostomy: A surgical procedure in which an anastomosis is created between the stomach and the proximal loop of the jejunum.


Endoscopic duodenal stents: A stent is a small metal mesh tube that is placed in the narrowed or blocked area of your duodenum (first part of the small intestine).

","Types of Pancreatitis

When digestive juices or enzymes attack the pancreas it causes redness and swelling (inflammation) of the pancreas. Types of pancreatitis include:
1. Acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. In acute pancreatitis, inflammation lasts for a short duration (a week). In this condition, the pancreas returns to normal afterward.
 
Note: Acute pancreatitis is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age.

2. Chronic pancreatitis

This is a condition where the pancreas becomes permanently damaged from inflammation. In chronic pancreatitis, inflammation lasts for a long duration that comes and goes over time. It often causes scarring of pancreatic tissue. It may also cause the pancreas to stop making enzymes and insulin in severe cases.

",,,"Diagnosis Of Pancreatitis

The detailed evaluation of a patient is required to diagnose pancreatitis. It includes:
1. History
The doctor in charge of your care will ask you about the history of your symptoms. They may also carry out a physical examination. If you have acute pancreatitis, certain areas of your abdomen will be very tender to touch. The doctor may ask about a detailed history of medical conditions such as:

Gallbladder stones
Alcohol abuse
Medication use
History of weight loss
History of diabetes
Previous surgery or trauma
Hypertriglyceridemia or hypercalcemia (high levels of lipids and calcium)
Autoimmune disease
Genetic causes


2. Laboratory evaluation


Blood test: A blood test will be carried out to detect signs of acute pancreatitis which involves the release of pancreatic enzymes. These include:


Elevated amylase level in the blood


Elevated serum blood lipase level (a more specific indicator of pancreatitis than amylase levels)


Increased urine amylase level


Other tests include: Complete blood count, serum lactate, serum triglycerides, c-reactive protein (CRP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN).







Pancreatic function test (PFT): This test measures how your pancreas responds to secretin, a hormone made by the small intestine.




Stool test: This test is done to find out if a person has a problem with the absorption of fats.




HbA1c level: It is a blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. 


Genetic testing: It is done to know the genetic history or if the patient has any kind of genetic disorder.Book your tests here



3. Imaging Tests

The following imaging tests that can show swelling of the pancreas may be done, such as-


Ultrasound: This test involves the use of high-frequency ultrasounds to visualize the organs and structures within the pancreas.


Computed tomography (CT) scan: These are the standard non-invasive imaging techniques used to assess people who may have chronic pancreatitis.


 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: MRI and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are recommended, especially in patients without specific changes detected on CT scans. 


Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): It is carried out to look for fibrosis (thickened and stiff tissues) in patients with chronic pancreatitis.


Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): It involves injecting you with a substance known as a contrast agent that makes your pancreas and surrounding organs show up very clearly on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.

 
4. Biopsy
A biopsy involves taking a small sample of cells from the pancreas and sending it to a laboratory, so it can be checked under a microscope for the presence of cancerous cells.","Prevention Of Pancreatitis

","Symptoms Of Peptic Ulcer Disease
The symptoms of peptic ulcer disease may vary from person to person, depending on the site of the ulcer and age. Ulcer in the stomach is called a gastric ulcer whereas the ulcer in the duodenum (part of the small intestine) is called a duodenal ulcer.One of the most common symptoms of peptic ulcer disease is gnawing pain in the abdomen. However, not everyone with this condition experience symptoms. Some people do not notice any signs of the disease until complications such as internal bleeding or abdominal perforation develop.The tell-a-tale signs and symptoms of peptic ulcer disease include the following:

Pain in the stomach

Peptic ulcer-related pain radiates from the middle of your stomach and travels to the neck region and down to the naval area or your back. It is characterized by a gnawing or burning sensation.One can differentiate between gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer based on the timing of the appearance of their symptoms on meal consumption. Pain occurs shortly after meals in case of gastric ulcer and 90-180 minutes after meals in case of duodenal ulcer. People with duodenal ulcers also often experience nocturnal pain (pain during the night). 
Bloating
Bloating can make you feel like your stomach is full of air or gas. It can be a very uncomfortable feeling.
Blood in vomit
Also known as hematemesis, it is a severe condition that requires immediate medical attention. 

Blood in stool

If your stools are black, it might indicate gastrointestinal bleeding.Other gastric ulcer symptoms include:


A feeling of fullness in the abdomen


Vomiting and nausea


Weight loss


The warning symptoms that require urgent medical care include:


Unexplained weight loss


Deficiency of iron


Gastrointestinal bleeding 


Dysphagia or difficulty swallowing


Excessive vomiting


Here’s more on the common causes of a stomach ache and when to consult a doctor for a stomach ache. Click To Know!","Causes Of Peptic Ulcer Disease
Peptic ulcers develop when digestive acid works against the defense mechanism of the stomach and eats up the protective lining covering it. The common causes of peptic ulcers are helicobacter pylori (bacteria) infection and excessive consumption of NSAIDs. 

H. pylori Infection

H. pylori can affect people of all ages and is one of the most common causes of PUD. The infection can go unnoticed as it doesn’t cause any symptoms in its early course of infection. The bacteria is present in the stomach lining. It generally causes no problems; however, in some cases, it can irritate the lining and make it weak and prone to stomach acid to get through the stomach lining leading to the development of ulcers.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Although doctors prescribe these medications to treat pain, inflammation, and fever; some take them without symptoms. Unnecessary consumption of NSAIDs for a long time or in high doses can lead to side effects such as stomach ulcers.

Lifestyle factors 

Some lifestyle factors may also lead to the formation of ulcers in your stomach or duodenum. These include:


Eating spicy food


Drinking alcohol


Stress

",,"Diagnosis Of Peptic Ulcer Disease
To begin with, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and whether you have been taking NSAIDs. They may also test you for H. pylori infection. 
Medical examination for H. pylori infection
If your doctor suspects you have an H. pylori infection, they will suggest taking the following tests.


Urea breath test: It is a breath test in which your doctor will ask you to have a special drink containing urea and then analyze your breath for the bacteria based on the amount of carbon dioxide you exhale after drinking the solution.

Stool antigen test: In this test, the doctor will test your stool sample for the bacteria.

Helicobacter pylori IgG test: Your doctor will take your blood sample and test it for antibodies against the H. pylori bacteria.

Gastroscopy
During this procedure, your doctor uses an endoscope (flexible and thin) with a camera fitted on its end. They will administer a mild sedative and spray a local anesthesia and then insert this tube inside your mouth to see the inside pictures of your stomach and intestine. As it is usually an outpatient procedure, you can go home the same day as the test.In addition to permitting direct visualization of the gastric mucosa, endoscopy facilitates photographic documentation of any mucosal defect and tissue biopsy to rule out malignancy or H. pylori infection.","Prevention Of Peptic Ulcer Disease

Prevention of peptic ulcers can be difficult sometimes. We still don’t completely know the mechanism of how the bacteria spread and how some people develop peptic ulcers without H. pylori infection. Researchers and medical experts from all over the world are working on developing a vaccine to cure peptic ulcer disease. Some preventive measures you may practice include the following:

Avoid irritants
The food you eat goes straight to your stomach. Therefore, make sure to avoid the food items that can irritate it. Especially, stay away from common food items you know can upset your stomach such as spicy foods, oily foods and citrus fruits.

Quit smoking
If you are a heavy smoker, your risk of developing duodenal ulcers is higher compared to a person who does not smoke. Therefore, you should quit smoking. If you are unable to stop smoking even after making deliberate attempts, you may consider consulting a counselor.Tobacco is injurious to health. Explore our range of smoking cessation products.  Click Here!
Control alcohol consumption
Heavy intake of alcohol can lead to the development of peptic ulcers and many other health complications. Therefore, you should drink alcohol in moderation. And, if you can stop drinking, there could be nothing better.

Limit intake on painkillers
Many people take pain killers, especially NSAIDs, unnecessarily. Some people take these medications without food, which increases their risk of developing peptic ulcers. To prevent the condition from damaging the protective lining of your stomach, take NSAIDs with food and only when necessary.

Control stress
Practice guided meditation and exercise regularly to relax your mind and body. This will also help you cope with increasing stress levels.Is stress affecting your work-life balance?

If you are diagnosed with a peptic ulcer disease, your doctor will decide the treatment plan based on the cause of the disease. With the appropriate treatment, it may take around a month or two to heal.If Helicobacter pylori infection or/and taking NSAIDs is the reason for your ulcer, your doctor is likely to prescribe a course of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitor (PPI)If the use of NSAIDs is the only cause for your peptic ulcer, your doctor is likely to recommend a course of PPI medicine. Occasionally, the doctor may also prescribe H2-receptor antagonists instead of proton pump inhibitors. For short-term relief from ulcer symptoms, your doctor might prescribe antacids.Your doctor may also recommend another gastroscopy procedure, 4 to 6 weeks after treatment to check whether your ulcer has healed.

Medicines
Antibiotics
If H. pylori infection has caused the ulcer in your stomach, your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics. Antibiotics may cause mild side effects, including diarrhea, not feeling well, and a metallic taste in your mouth. These medications kill the bacteria to help you heal faster. Some widely prescribed antibiotics include:


Amoxicillin


Clarithromycin


Metronidazole


Tetracycline


Nitroimidazole


Levofloxacin


Doxycycline


Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
This class of medication helps reduce the amount of acid production by your stomach to prevent more damage to the ulcer. The course of treatment generally lasts for 4 to 8 weeks.Some examples of protein pump inhibitors include:


Omeprazole


Pantoprazole


Rabeprazole


Lansoprazole


Although PPIs do not have any severe side effects, they may include the following:


Feeling sick


Diarrhea


Constipation


Headache


Pain in the stomach


Dizziness


Long term intake of PPIs may lead to development of the following potential adverse effects:


Acute kidney disease


Chronic kidney disease


Hypomagnesemia


Clostridium difficile infections


H2-receptor antagonists
H2-receptor antagonists, also known as histamine H2-receptor antagonists and H2 blockers, are a group of medications that help reduce the amount of acid production in the stomach as PPIs do. Some examples of H2 blockers include:


Famotidine


Nizatidine 


Although not very common, some of its side effects that can occur include:


Pain in the stomach


Dizziness


Headaches


Constipation or diarrhea


Rashes


Antacids
As the medications mentioned above generally start their action after several hours of administration, your doctor may recommend antacids to get short-term but immediate relief. Antacids help neutralize the acid present in your stomach to provide relief from acidity. Some antacids may also contain alginate, a drug that creates a protective coating over your stomach's lining. You can get these medications as over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Some side effects of these drugs include the following:


Feeling sick


Flatulence


Constipation (caused by aluminum containing preparations)


Diarrhea (caused by magnesium containing preparations)


Stomach cramps


Note: If taking NSAIDs is the reason for your stomach ulcer, your doctor is likely to review how you use these medicines. They might suggest you take an alternative painkiller like paracetamol, as it is not associated with ulcers. Your doctor may also prescribe another class of NSAIDs known as a COX-2 inhibitor.If you have been taking a course of low-dose aspirin to minimize the possibility of blood clots, inform your doctor. Your doctor is the right person to tell you if you should keep taking it.

Surgery

If you are unresponsive to the treatment options given above or not compliant, your doctor may prescribe surgery to heal the peptic ulcer. Surgical procedures include:


Vagotomy: It is a surgical procedure which involves cutting off one or more branches of the vagus nerve to reduce the rate of gastric secretion. 




Antrectomy: This procedure involves surgical removal of the walls of the gastric or pyloric tantrum in the stomach. 




Pyloroplasty: It is a procedure to widen the opening in the lower part of the stomach to allow the food to empty directly in the small intestine. 




Artery tying off: If an ulcer in the stomach is bleeding, your doctor may cut off an artery to stop the blood supply to the region.

",,"Home-care For Peptic Ulcer Disease
What you eat and how you eat play a crucial role in peptic ulcer management at home. Here are some do's and don'ts for people with peptic ulcer disease.

","Complications Of Peptic Ulcer Disease

Usually, peptic ulcer disease do not cause any complications. However, the condition, if not diagnosed and treated on time, can cause severe complications. Following are the possible complications with peptic ulcer disease.

Internal bleeding 

It is the most prevalent complication of PUD. It mainly occurs if you have got an ulcer near a blood vessel. Internal bleeding is of two types:


Long-term and slow bleeding: It can lead to many other complications including anemia, pale skin, breathlessness, increased heartbeat, and fatigue.

Rapid bleeding: It can lead to blood in vomit and passing black stools.

Perforation
Although rare, it can be painful. It happens when the protective lining of your stomach perforates and breaks, allowing bacteria to live in your stomach and infect the peritoneum (lining of your abdomen). The condition is known as peritonitis. This health condition, if not treated on time, can spread into the blood and cause sepsis. It can also lead to multiple organ failures.

Gastric outlet obstruction

Sometimes, a scarred or swollen ulcer can block the passage of food in your digestive system leading to gastric outlet obstruction. The symptoms include:


Feeling bloated or full all the time


Bouts of vomiting contain undigested food 


Unexplained weight loss


Cancer
Helicobacter pylori as the etiological factor increases the chances of getting stomach cancer from the ulcer.","Alternative Treatments For Peptic Ulcer Disease

","Types Of Dysmenorrhea

Mild pain and discomfort during menstrual periods are normal. However, excessive pain and cramping that interfere with your daily activity or work are not normal. Dysmenorrhea can be classified into two types:
 
Primary dysmenorrhea.


This type of dysmenorrhea occurs due to menstrual pain that’s not only a symptom of an underlying gynecologic disorder. 


It is the most common type of dysmenorrhea, affecting more than 50% of menstruating women.


It is generally seen in younger girls soon after they attain menarche (puberty). 


It can cause mild to severe menstrual pain and cramping which usually gets maximum at the starting of the cycle and then reduces in severity. 


Secondary dysmenorrhea.


This type is a result of menstrual pain that’s a symptom of an underlying gynecologic disorder such as endometriosis, uterine fibroid, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).


Generally, it starts later in life as compared to primary dysmenorrhea and its symptoms tend to get worse over time. 


During the menstrual cycle, the severe pain and cramping begin even 2 or 3 days before the cycle starts and may continue even after it ends.

","Symptoms Of Dysmenorrhoea

Menstrual cramps usually begin 2 to 3 days before your periods, peak 24 hours after the onset of your period, and subside in a day or two. 
 
Some of the common signs and symptoms of dysmenorrhea include the following:
 


Cramping in the lower abdomen


Pain in the lower abdomen


Low back pain


Pain radiating down the legs


Breast tenderness


Vomiting or nausea


Feeling emotional or tearful


Diarrhea or constipation


Faintness


Fatigue or tiredness


Bloating


Headache


Signs and symptoms of secondary dysmenorrhea are:


Irregular periods


Heavy bleeding during periods


Vaginal discharge with a foul smell


Pain during sexual intercourse


Pain in your back passage (rectum)



While discussing painful periods, it is also important to know what normal periods are. It is equally prudent to know out for any red flags and check timely with your doctor. To read more Click Here","Causes Of Dysmenorrhoea

Primary dysmenorrhea
Prostaglandins are hormone-like substances that control the contractions of the uterus (womb). The cells that form the lining of the uterus begin to break down during periods and release large levels of prostaglandins.Vasopressin is another hormone that is responsible for vasoconstriction which causes uterine contractions.Women with primary dysmenorrhea are found to have excessive levels of prostaglandins and vasopressin. These naturally occurring chemicals constrict the blood vessels in the uterus, cutting off the oxygen supply to muscle tissue. This leads to muscle contractions and painful cramps. 
Secondary dysmenorrhea 
Various conditions that are associated with secondary dysmenorrhea include:


Endometriosis: This is a condition in which the cells that form the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) grow outside the uterus. It causes internal bleeding, infection, and pelvic pain. 


Uterine growths: Fibroids, cysts, and endometrial polyps (benign growths in the wall of the uterus) are the most common noncancerous tumors in women of childbearing age. They can cause severe abdominal pain and excessive bleeding during periods.


Adenomyosis: This condition occurs when the lining of the uterus grows into the muscle of the uterus (womb). It can cause the uterus to get much bigger than it should be, along with abnormal bleeding, cramping, and pain.


Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): It is a severe female inflammatory reproductive organs disorder caused by bacterial infection of the genital tract such as a sexually transmitted infection. 


Structural differences: Some women are born with structural differences in size and shape of their wombs that cause more painful periods.

To diagnose dysmenorrhea, your doctor will likely take your medical history and perform a physical exam (pelvic exam). If they think an underlying disorder is causing your symptoms, they may perform other tests like:
Blood tests: These tests rule out any infectious process in the pelvic organs. These might include a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and differential count (DC).
Urine tests: This test helps diagnose urinary tract infections (UTIs).
Sexually transmitted diseases tests: This panel of tests help determine any sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia and syphilis. For a bacteria culture test, your doctor may take a sample of blood, stool, urine, skin, or mucus.
Ultrasonography: This imaging test uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the internal organs present in the lower abdomen of the body, including the pelvic cavity and reproductive system. This test helps in the evaluation of unexplained pelvic pain, inflammation, abnormal bleeding, or infection.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This test uses large magnets, radiofrequency, and a computer to make detailed images of internal organs and structures. It is particularly helpful in diagnosing endometriosis and adenomyosis of the uterus.
Laparoscopy: It is required when all non-invasive investigations fail to lead to a diagnosis. In this procedure, a thin fiber tube (which has a lens and a light) is inserted into an incision in the abdominal wall. This tube relays images of the inside of the abdomen or pelvis to a television screen. This procedure is also known as keyhole surgery or minimally invasive surgery.","Prevention Of Dysmenorrhea
 
Following are a few tips that can help you prevent dysmenorrhea:
Quit smoking
Smoking tobacco can cause severe menstrual cramps and is associated with a higher risk of dysmenorrhea. Quitting will not only help with dysmenorrhea but also improve your overall health.
Lose the extra kgs
Research has shown that overweight women are more at risk for dysmenorrhea. Losing and maintaining a proper weight may help reduce the severity of cramps.
Stay active
Light exercises, such as walking, jogging, or stretching, can help you produce chemicals that block pain. Therefore, make exercise a part of your lifestyle to prevent menstrual cramps in the long run and have pain-free periods. 
A study also found that exercise helps reduce stress, which is also one of the factors linked to dysmenorrhoea. 
Deaddict from alcohol and caffeinated beverages
Avoid or limit the intake of alcohol and other caffeinated drinks and beverages like sodas, coffee, and tea. They can increase vasoconstriction (the narrowing of blood vessels), which can further worsen the cramps during your menstruation cycle.
Practice yoga and meditation
Holistic living that includes yoga and meditation provides relief to the symptoms of dysmenorrhea.

Dysmenorrhea can be treated with medicines and in a few cases with surgery. It depends on the severity and underlying cause of your pain. Here are some of the common treatment options for dysmenorrhea:
Pain relief medications:
NSAIDs are usually the first-line therapy for painful periods and should be tried for at least three menstrual cycles. They act by decreasing prostaglandin production. This consequently reduces prostaglandin concentration in menstrual fluid, leading to decreased uterine contractility and menstrual volume.
The most commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are:


Diclofenac


Ibuprofen


Ketoprofen


Mefenamic acid


 
These drugs are most effective when started before the onset of symptoms and continued for 3 days.
These are usually safe and well tolerated. Side effects might include gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and heartburn.
Combined oral contraceptive pills:
This is the second line of treatment. If NSAIDs alone are not sufficient, oral contraceptives might be combined with them. 
These medicines contain hormones (estrogen and progesterone) which prevent ovulation (the monthly release of an egg) and reduce the release of prostaglandins. This in turn, brings almost immediate relief from symptoms associated with menstruation: heavy periods, painful periods, and irregular bleeding.
These hormones are available as a pill, skin patch, flexible ring inserted into the vagina, or an intrauterine device (IUD). 
Progestin-only methods:
Progestins-only hormones show efficacy in the treatment of menstrual pain by causing endometrial atrophy and inhibiting ovulation. These are more suitable for patients with secondary dysmenorrhea related to endometriosis.
Various drugs and methods of delivery include:


Desogestrel


Medroxyprogesterone


Intrauterine levonorgestrel-releasing device (IUS) 


Subdermal implant with etonogestrel release


Managing underlying conditions:
In the case of secondary dysmenorrhea, it is important to identify and treat the root cause of menstrual cramps. Generally, in this type, the menstrual cramps are caused by underlying disorders, such as endometriosis, fibroids, adenomyosis, etc. 
For example, to treat endometriosis (the lining of the endometrium grows outside of the uterus), removal of the endometriotic tissue is done through surgery which can provide great relief in menstrual cramps.","Home-care For Dysmenorrhea
The following home care remedies and tips can go a long way in managing  dysmenorrhea:
Use A Heating Pad
Topical heat is an effective and low-cost natural method to manage dysmenorrhea. You can place a heating pad or a hot water pack over your lower abdominal area. The application of heat helps to improve the blood flow to the site of application and thus, aids in relieving pain. If you do not have a heat pack at home, you can soak a towel in slightly hot water, squeeze it to drain excess water and apply it on the abdomen. You can also use a hot water bottle to do the same.
Exercise
Exercise helps to release the pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins and helps you to fight pain and cramps during periods. Moreover, exercising increases the circulation to the pelvic region and releases hormones to counteract the pain-inducing prostaglandins.
Make certain tweaks to your diet
Arachidonic acid is a fatty acid and works as a precursor in the production of prostaglandins. Intake of a low-fat diet, beans, fruits, and vegetables helps to lower the production of arachidonic acid. Therefore, switching to a healthy, clean diet may help to control symptoms of dysmenorrhea. 
It is equally significant to be informed about what all food items to avoid during periods.Foods that worsen your period pain! Tap Here
Augment your diet with supplements
Vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and magnesium supplements have also been found to be highly effective in giving relief from pain associated with menstrual cramps. 
Drink more water
It is a common myth that drinking water during periods causes more blood flow. In fact, drinking 6-8 glasses of water is the best way to not only prevent bloating but also to manage period pain. You can also add some lemon or mint to water or load up your intake of foods rich in water such as cucumbers and watermelons to increase your water intake.
Consume Herbal Teas
The following ingredients are easily found in Indian kitchens. Make herbal teas from them to combat period pain:
Fenugreek (Methi): Fenugreek consumption has shown positive results in many problems related to the menstrual cycle and reproduction. It is considered to relieve menstrual cramps and helps to treat irregular periods. You can consume fenugreek tea by boiling it in water and then straining its grains. You can add it to your meal too. 
Cumin (Jeera seeds): It is an Indian spice that helps to reduce period pain. Due to its relaxing effect, antioxidant, antispasmodic, and anti-inflammatory properties, it can relieve pain and spasms.
Ginger (Adrak): It has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties that help to relieve menstrual pain associated with primary dysmenorrhea. It has great efficacy with no side effects.
Turmeric (Haldi): The use of curcumin for the treatment of different diseases is mentioned in Ayurveda. It also helps to reduce the production of prostaglandins which are involved in the pathogenesis of dysmenorrhea.
Apple Cider Vinegar: It contains a good amount of potassium and calcium that help to ease muscle cramping during periods. You can have it by mixing one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water. However, make sure to consume it using a stainless steel straw as it can erode teeth.
Cinnamon (Dalchini): It is another Indian spice that has excellent antispasmodic properties that help to reduce menstrual cramps and pain. It also helps in regulating menstrual irregularities, heavy menstrual bleeding, nausea, and vomiting with primary dysmenorrhea. You can have cinnamon powder with lukewarm water. You can also sprinkle it on your meals. 
Chamomile: It is rich in antioxidants and helps to relieve pain originating from primary dysmenorrhea. It has antispasmodic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. You can simply have it by boiling it in hot water and then straining it. It also improves mood swings during periods.

Women who experience severe menstrual cramps can try alternative therapies to ease their symptoms. However, it is always better to consult your healthcare provider before starting any of these.
Massage with essential oils
Massage therapy shows effective results in women suffering from dysmenorrhea. In this therapy, essential oils such as Lavender oil, Cinnamon oil, Roman chamomile oil, Clary sage oil, and Marjoram oil are used which have antispasmodic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. 
You can massage your lower back and abdomen around bedtime for a restful sleep and relief from cramping.
Acupuncture and Acupressure therapy
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy that involves pointed fine needles inserted in areas of the body known as acupuncture points. Acupuncture may improve to ease the symptoms associated with menstrual cramps and stimulate specific nerves and muscles, which in turn release natural pain-relieving hormones in the body.
However, more research is required for their recommendation, and further studies are needed to prove their effectiveness. They may be an alternative in women not interested in pharmacological management.
Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)
It is a noninvasive, inexpensive and portable therapy that delivers electrical currents through the skin. 
Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of TENS in reducing pain, decreasing the use of analgesics, and improving the quality of life in primary dysmenorrhea patients.
Yoga and meditation
Practicing yoga and meditation regularly has proven to relieve stress, manage anxiety, and pain management. A study shows that practicing yoga for 60 minutes once a week may also help to reduce period cramps.","Complications Of Dysmenorrhea
Primary dysmenorrhea presents with mild to severe abdominal pains and cramps which can affect the overall well-being and quality of life of a woman. However, primary dysmenorrhea is not linked to any underlying conditions and therefore shows no complications.
In the case of secondary dysmenorrhea, complications depend on the cause. These might include:


Infertility: One of the problems caused by secondary dysmenorrhea is infertility or the inability to conceive a child.Endometriosis, for example, is an underlying condition associated with secondary dysmenorrhea which can change the shape of the pelvis and reproductive organs. It can make it difficult for the sperm to find the egg or deform the fallopian tubes in such a way that they are not able to pick up the egg after ovulation.

Miscarriage: Serious hormonal imbalance can also lead to miscarriage or other complications associated with pregnancy. 


Psychological stress: Irregular periods can be stressful, especially for women who are trying to conceive and plan a family. 


Osteoporosis: Levels of estrogen play a vital role in overall bone health. Lack of estrogen production may cause a high risk of brittle or weak bones and joints. 


Anemia: If any structural problem such as the size and shape of the uterus is causing dysmenorrhea, it may cause heavy bleeding during periods which may lead to anemia. 


Insomnia: Painful cramps can severely affect the sleep cycle or cause insomnia.

Painful periods poorly affect daily work or activities of females. Young girls end up missing school. It also impacts academic or work performance in terms of concentration, socialization and achievement. Dysmenorrhea could also limit women's participation in sports or social events. Sleep disturbances due to menstrual pain further hurt the productivity of women.
 
Painful periods are the main cause of recurrent short-term school absence in adolescent girls and a common problem in women of reproductive age.If you are experiencing symptoms of dysmenorrhea or it is very challenging for you just simply follow these tips to ease your menstrual cramps:


During menstruation, getting a good amount of rest is essential. You can use a heating pad or hot bottle of water to ease the pain. A warm bath can also help to reduce the overall pain.


Certain foods can help to ease your cramps such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Eating a healthy diet decreases inflammation in the body and also helps to tame menstrual cramps.


Constipation, bloating and an upset stomach are other common problems for women with dysmenorrhea, therefore it is advised to hydrate yourself and include fiber-rich food to relieve the symptoms.


Diet rich in vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and magnesium has been found to be highly effective in giving relief from pain associated with menstrual cramps. 


Regular exercise such as walking, jogging, and stretching improves blood circulation and helps nutrients and oxygen flow to all the systems of the body. Certain chemicals (endorphins) are released during exercise which helps to block the pain.


Avoid caffeinated drinks and beverages as they may increase vasoconstriction (the narrowing of blood vessels), which can further worsen cramps during your menstruation cycle.

Specialists to consult: General physicianInfectious disease specialist
","Types of Q fever
The infection can cause two types of Q fever that vary by severity and nature. The two types are:Acute Q feverThis form of Q fever usually begins two to three weeks after exposure to the bacterium. Acute Q fever is characterized by flu-like symptoms which include high fevers, chills, muscle pain, and headaches. Acute Q fever is usually self-limited which means it can resolve itself without treatment.Chronic Q feverThis form of Q fever may occur months to years after acute disease or without a previous history of acute Q fever. It has been observed that predisposing conditions such as pre-existing heart valve or vascular abnormalities or an immunocompromised immune system increases the risk for chronic Q fever.",,"Causes of Q fever
 
Q fever is caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. It is primarily found in cattle, sheep and goats. The bacteria pass into milk, urine and feces of infected herd animals. Infected aerosols can also travel, affecting people living downwind of an infected goat or sheep farm.Other causes include contact with contaminated clothing, wool, hides or straw, dressing infected animals or consuming infected raw or unpasteurized dairy products. Usually, Q fever is an occupational disease seen in slaughterhouse and dairy workers, livestock farmers, rendering-plant workers, herders, woolsorters, veterinarians or those involved in animal studies or research. The bacterium is highly infectious in nature and remains viable in dust and stool for months. Even a quick exposure to the bacterium can cause an infection. However, person-to-person spread is extremely unlikely. Very rarely, Q fever can spread through blood transfusion, from a pregnant woman to her fetus, through sexual intercourse or by the bite of an infected tick.","Risk Factors For Q fever
 
Q fever can infect men more often than women and adults more often than children. However, it has been commonly reported in elderly males. Certain factors can increase your risk of getting infected with Q fever, which include:
1. Occupation
The following are at high risk as they are exposed to animals and animal products: 


Workers in cattle, sheep, and goat abattoirs


Farmers, stockyard workers, and livestock transporters


Dairy workers


Wool shearers and sorters


Agricultural college staff and students


Wildlife and zoo workers exposed to high-risk animals


Veterinarians, veterinary nurses, and students


Tanning and hide workers


Professional dog and cat breeders


Laboratory workers handling veterinary products or working with Coxiella burnetii


Others who are exposed to cattle, camels, sheep and goats or their products


2. Location
If you are located close to a farm or farming facility or live on a farm that may increase your risk towards the disease.

3. Season

Though there is no specific time of year when one can get infected, it seems to be more common in the spring and early summer.
4. Consumption of unpasteurized milk or dairy products
Not often, but rare cases were reported by consuming infected raw, unpasteurized milk or dairy products.

5. Immunocompromised individuals

A weak immune system can increase the risk for a severe form of the infection. Some of the common reasons that lead to weakening of the immune system include:


Malnutrition


Certain diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer 


Genetic disorders


Excessive consumption of medicines such as steroids, anti-cancer drugs, and painkillers


Lifestyle habits such as smoking, excessive drinking, and unhealthy eating

","Prevention Of Q Fever
If your occupation involves close contact with cattle, vaccination would be the best preventive measure. However, the Q fever vaccine is not available globally. If you are not vaccinated, primarily, Q fever can be prevented by being extra cautious if you are in close contact with cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses. 

Vaccination

There is a vaccine available for Q Fever named (Q-VAX®) which can help prevent the occurrence and severity of the infection. But it is only commercially available in Australia.However, pre-vaccination screening with skin and blood tests should be done to identify preexisting immunity to Q fever as vaccinating people who already have immunity can cause severe local reactions.If you are not vaccinated and are at a high risk for Q fever you must follow these preventive measures:


Disinfect and decontaminate areas in the workplace or house where you suspect an exposure to the infection


Avoid unnecessary contact with animals, especially the ones giving birth


Dispose of all birth materials after a livestock animal has given birth properly


Avoid dogs, cats, birds, and other animals from scavenging birthing products


Wash your hands properly at regular intervals


Perform regular tests and inspection on animals and farms


Avoid consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products


Pregnant women should avoid helping with livestock birth


Minimize or restrict the airflow from facilities that house animals to residential areas


Quarantine infected and exposed animals


Practice safe workplace practices, protocols and procedures to minimize risk of infection

","Treatment Of Q Fever
The severity of the disease and symptoms plays a key role in deciding the treatment regime for Q fever.In most cases, asymptomatic cases and people with a mild infection showing symptoms usually resolve within a few weeks without any treatment. However, in case of a severe infection your doctor will have to prescribe a medication – an antibiotic. 

1. Antibiotic therapy 

Doxycycline is the most commonly prescribed antibiotic for treating Q fever. People with chronic Q fever usually are prescribed a combination of antibiotics for a span of 18 months. Once the chronic Q fever is treated, your doctor may ask you to come back for follow up tests to confirm the absence of recurrence.

2. Anti-inflammatory drugs

Some individuals might not respond to the antibiotic treatment, in that case, the doctor will prescribe some anti-inflammatory drugs. Hydroxychloroquine, a drug used for treating malaria, has been found to be effective against Q fever. If you are pregnant and show symptoms of the disease, your doctor will recommend an antibiotic treatment. The medication type may vary depending on your condition.

3. Multiple/combination drugs 

Chronic Q fever, the severe form of the infection, can be difficult to treat. Endocarditis, inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves, may require the patient to undergo multiple drug treatments. People with heart conditions require an early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment for at least 18 months.","Home-care For Q Fever
Q fever is a bacterial infection and in most cases the infection is self limited. In case of severe symptoms, the disease can be managed using antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Some tips to manage the symptoms of Q fever include:


Stay home and avoid contact with anyone.


Eat healthy, nutrient dense and easy to digest food.


Consume fluids (water, coconut water, electrolytes, soups, and fresh juices) to stay hydrated, if you have diarrhea as one of the key symptoms.


Take plenty of rest as it will help the body fight against the infection and cope with the condition. 

","Living With Q Fever
In some cases, people may get a reinfection or the severity of the disease may lead to chronic Q fever and related complications. Here are some tips that will help you get better:


If you have mild flu-like symptoms, your symptoms may resolve in a few weeks (1-2). If you don’t feel better, book an appointment and see your doctor. 


If you are immunocompromised or have a heart or lung condition, take extra care until the symptoms resolve. Your doctor may even call you frequently for follow up tests even after the infection has been treated. 


Q fever and other diseases
Below is a list of some other bacterial diseases which cause similar symptoms and therefore it is important to understand how these diseases seem to be similar to Q fever yet are different.  


Legionnaires’ disease is a rare infectious bacterial disease caused by Legionella pneumophila. The infection is contracted by inhaling contaminated water from showers and whirlpool baths. Some of the common symptoms of the disease include severe pneumonia, chills, fevers, cough and a sharp pain in the side of the chest.




Rocky mountain spotted fever is a bacterial disease caused by R. rickettsii. The disease is characterized with mild to serious symptoms such as headache, fever, chills, muscle aches (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia), extreme exhaustion (prostration), and/or a characteristic skin rash. 




Brucellosis is an infectious disease that affects livestock and can get transmitted to humans. The infection is caused by the bacteria that belongs to the genus Brucella. Common symptoms of the infection include fevers, muscle pain, headache, loss of appetite, profuse sweating, and physical weakness. Similar to Q fever, brucellosis can be prevented by avoiding consumption of unpasteurized milk. 




Tularemia is a bacterial infection that commonly affects small mammals such as rabbits, rodents and hares. It is a highly transmissible disease and gets transmitted when the diseased animal bites a human or it gets bitten by a tick or fly. 

","Complications Of Q Fever
In most cases, the symptoms of Q fever are mild flu-like and resolve within a few days to week. If the Q fever persists or reoccurs, it can cause complications that can severely damage organs such as heart, lungs, liver, and brain. Chronic Q fever is the severe form of Q fever which develops months or years after the first diagnosis. Complications caused due to chronic Q fever are:


Pneumonia, which affects 30%-50% of patients can lead to acute respiratory distress and may sometimes cause a medical emergency


Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver)


Myocarditis or endocarditis (inflammation of heart)




Meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the spinal cord and brain) or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)


Osteomyelitis (bone inflammation)


Acalculous cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder)


Persistent fatigue (also called post-Q fever fatigue syndrome, which lasts more than a year after the infection)


Pregnancy problems such as miscarriage, low birth weight, premature birth, and stillbirth could be seen due to severity of Q fever


Many patients with Q fever may also develop long term complications such as chronic and persistent fatigue.","Alternative Therapies For Q Fever
Since Q fever is an infectious bacterial disease, it can only be treated with antibiotics. There are no alternative therapies available for the disease.  "

Specialists to consult: General physicianInfectious disease specialistNeurologistNeurosurgeon
","Causes Of Rabies
Rabies is caused by the rabies virus that usually gets transmitted from infected animals. The virus lives in the saliva, brain and spinal cord of the infected animal. Rabies can infect mammals such as dogs, cats, bats, monkeys, foxes, raccoons, skunks, jackals and mongooses. The most common cause of transmission in humans are dogs. 
Transmission
The salivary glands play a very important role in spreading the infection. When an infected animal bite, the virus is released through saliva into the person’s body. The infection can spread through: 


Bite of an infected animal


Scratches by claws of infected animal


Exposure of the infected saliva to nose, eyes, mouth, or cut skin


Rabies virus can also be transmitted from human to human through transplantation of the cornea or other organ. Although this transmission is rare, it is possible. Therefore, the corneas and other organs of a person who died of rabies should not be used for transplantation.Note: Rabies is not spread by petting or touching dried saliva, blood, urine, or feces of a rabid animal.After entering into the bloodstream, the virus enters into the central nervous system. After establishing the infection in the brain, the virus travels down the nerves from the brain and multiplies in different organs causing several complications. ",,"Symptoms Of Rabies

Symptoms of rabies can be divided into the following stages: Stage 1 (Incubation): It is the period from exposure of virus to the onset of symptoms and differs from person to person. This time is generally 2 to 3 months but may range from 1 week to 1 year. It is dependent on factors such as site of entry of the virus and the viral loadStage 2 (Prodrome): This stage consists of non-specific symptoms that mostly resemble the flu with several gastrointestinal symptoms:


Fever


Headache


Malaise


Decrease in appetite


Pain, numbness, tingling, and itching at the wound site


Stage 3 (Neurological): In this stage, the virus reaches the central nervous system. It causes fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord which can be experienced as the following symptoms: 


Anxiety


Confusion


Agitation


Delirium


Disturbed behavior


Hallucinations


Hydrophobia (fear of water) 


Insomnia


Muscle aches


Weak arms and legs


Difficulty in swallowing


Aerophobia (fear of fresh air)


Stage 4 (Coma): This stage usually develops within ten days of stage 3. Patients may have consistent hydrophobia and can develop paralysis. Stage 5 (Death): The stage 4 can lead to death within 2 to 3 days without supportive care.","Types Of Rabies
Rabies can be divided into two types depending upon the symptoms. These are:
Encephalitic (furious) rabies
It is the most prevalent form of rabies and affects 85% of the population infected with the rabies virus. 
In this type, patients experience symptoms such as: 


Hyperactivity


Excitable behavior


Hydrophobia(fear of water)


Aerophobia(fear of flying)


Tachycardia (increase in heart rate)


Tachypnea (abnormal rapid breathing)


It can also be life threatening due to cardio-pulmonary arrest. 
Paralytic rabies
As the name suggests, it causes paralysis of muscles that usually starts at the site bitten by the animal. Almost 20% of cases of rabies are of the paralytic type. It may also result in coma and eventually death of the patient. 
This form is often misinterpreted as normal paralysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome due to the absence of classical symptoms of rabies which include hydrophobia. Patients may also feel:


Ongoing fevers


Weakness


Bladder dysfunction


Classic form
This form of rabies is rare, generally associated with seizures and more profound motor and sensory symptoms.","Diagnosis Of Rabies
An immediate medical attention is essential, if anybody is suspected to be bitten or scratched by an animal as there is no direct way to recognise a rabid animal.However, the diagnostic tests can confirm the infection but it usually takes time and the dependency on the results can delay the treatment process.  
Testing the animal
The animal that is caught biting or scratching is first tested for rabies. This testing may save a patient from unnecessary physical, psychological, and financial stress if the animal is not found to be rapid. The rabies is usually diagnosed by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test. The DFA test detects the rabies virus antigens in brain tissue of the euthanized (put to death humanely) animal.Animals that are found to be healthy such as a vaccinated dog or cat are not usually tested and kept under observation for 10 days. After this period, a doctor usually decides what to do after discussing with the local health department. 
Testing in humans
Rabies can be confirmed by various tests that detect the whole virus, viral antigens, or nucleic acids in infected tissues. Some of the tests are discussed below:
Lumbar puncture
In this, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is taken for detection of the virus. The sample is taken using a thin needle from the lower part of the lumbar spine. 
Nuchal skin biopsy
It is the most reliable method of detecting the rabies virus during the first week. In this, a sample is collected from the skin of the back of the neck. The virus is detected using immunofluorescent antibody staining under a microscope. 
Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
In this, the saliva is tested for the presence of rabies virus. The method amplifies the genetic material of the virus (RNA) for the ease of identification. The test usually has high sensitivity and is used as a confirmatory test for detection of rabies infection. 
Blood tests
These tests are not used often for detection of rabies virus as the virus specific antibodies take time to reflect in the blood. They are mainly used to check the efficacy of the rabies vaccines given to the patient. The most common antibody test used is virus neutralization test which can be performed in two ways: 


Fluorescent antibody virus neutralization FAVN) test


Rapid fluorescent focus inhibition (RFFIT) test


Imaging tests
These tests are usually done to diagnose rabies encephalitis. The tests include:


Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of head: This imaging technique uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the brain.


Computed tomography (CT) scan of head: In this, X-rays are used to create detailed pictures of the head.. 

","Prevention Of Rabies

Eliminating rabies in animals 

Rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease. It is important to keep the vaccinations of your dogs, cats, ferrets, and selected livestock up-to-date. A booster vaccination is also recommended in case your dog and cat is attacked or bitten by a wild animal.
Vaccination 
The same vaccine that is used in animals is also used to immunize people after an exposure. In some cases, vaccination is also required in humans before exposure to rabies. The vaccines for rabies have been available for more than 125 years. Earlier nerve tissue vaccines were used which have now been replaced with various modern cell culture and embryonated egg-based vaccines (CCEEVs). CCEEVs are more effective than earlier vaccines and have lesser side effects. Vaccinations of high risk people (Pre-exposure vaccination)
Vaccination is also recommended for the people who are at high risk of getting the disease. These include: 


Veterinarian or an animal handler


Veterinary student


People who study or explore animals 


Students working on rabies virus


People traveling to the rabies prevalent countries


Vaccination is also recommended for children and infants living in an area with a high incidence of rabies and where the supply of immunoglobulin is limited. The vaccine can be given in 2 schedules, either via  intramuscular route or va intradermally at days 0, 7, and 21 and 28.The booster doses are required only in some cases where there is a continuous exposure of the rabies virus. In case of exposure to rabies virus to vaccinated people, still post-prophylaxis is required. Vaccination after an animal bite
The vaccination is required if a person is bitten by a rabid animal. In this case, a doctor usually decides if you need the rabies vaccine. The vaccine is given in 4 doses, if you have not previously been vaccinated for rabies. The first dose is given immediately after the bite, followed by additional 3 doses which are given after 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the first dose. The person who has already received the rabies vaccine, requires only 2 doses. The first dose is given immediately after the bite and the second dose is given after 3 days. Vaccines lower the immunity for a period of time. So, it is necessary to tell your doctor if:


Had an allergic reaction to the rabies vaccine in the past


Have severe other allergies


Have HIV infection


Have cancer


Are on some medications that can affect your immune system


Are pregnant or breastfeeding


But in case, if it is confirmed that you are bitten by a rabid animal, you need to get vaccinated even in the presence of these conditions. Side effects of vaccinationThe side effects of rabies vaccines are very mild and usually go away on their own. The common side effects include:


Pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site


Headache


Upset stomach


Pain in the stomach


Muscle aches


Dizziness


Some of the rare side effects include:


Itchy spots on the skin


Joint pain


Fever


Avoiding animal exposure
The best protection against rabies is to avoid any wild animal that can transmit rabies. The following measures should be taken to avoid the exposure:


Do not touch injured animals. In case you find an injured animal, contact the local authorities immediately for assistance.


Do not feed, play or pat unknown animals, especially in areas where rabies is known to occur.


Do not touch stray dogs and cats while traveling.


Do not allow your pets to roam free as they may be infected by other animals. 


Do not leave garbage or pet food outside. It may attract wild or stray animals.


Do not keep wild animals as pets. 


Do not ignore the strange behavior of your pet. Any change in behavior of the pet should be immediately reported to the veterinarian.


Do not allow kids to touch or feed stray cats and dogs that may be wandering around them. Educate and remind kids to stay away from stray animals. 


Awareness on rabies
It is very important to understand the risk of rabies. Rabies is a fatal disease which is transmitted through animals, especially dogs. But, rabies in humans can be prevented through prompt vaccination and appropriate medical care. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, immediately inform your doctor. Educating both children and adults about rabies and its prevention plays a very important role in limiting the exposure. Increasing awareness of rabies prevention and control in communities includes education and information on responsible pet ownership, how to prevent dog bites, and immediate care measures after a bite. ","Treatment Of Rabies

What to do after a bite or scratch by an animal, particularly a dog?



Wash the wounds with soap and water, immediately as it will reduce the chances of infection.


Flush the wound thoroughly for about 15 minutes with water.   


Give first aid to the wound that includes applying an iodine-containing or anti-viral medication 


Capture the animal in a large box, or atleast identify it, if possible. Do not risk further injury to yourself. 


Call your family doctor immediately and explain to him/her about the bite.


Call the Department of Health and animal control officer and provide them the accurate description of the animal.


Avoid covering the wound with dressings or bandages. 


Keep the biting animal under observation for 10 days. 


What to do if your pet is bitten or scratched by another animal, particularly a dog?


Wear rubber gloves while washing your pet’s wounds.


Call your pet’s veterinarian immediately.


Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
There is no specific treatment for rabies, if symptoms start to develop. Therefore, the focus is given on preventing the exposure.  Even if rabies is not confirmed, treatment should start straight away. This is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and is done to prevent the infection. PEP refers to the prompt treatment of a bite that might expose the person to rabies. This helps in preventing the entry of viruses into the brain and consists of: 


Extensive wound washing: It includes immediate washing of the wound with water, soap, detergent and povidone iodine for at least 15 minutes. This may help in removing or killing the virus. 


Administration of rabies immune globulin: This gives immediate protection before the vaccine starts to work.


Administration of rabies vaccine: The vaccine is injected immediately after a bite. It is given in 4 doses at 0,3rd, 7th, and 14th day of the bite. An extra dose at day 28 is also given to the patient with a weak immune system.

","Home-care For Rabies
Rabies is a serious disease that involves the nervous system. Most of the patients are admitted to hospitals for the treatment. The caregivers or the family plays a very important role in maintaining the overall health of the patient. The following measures can be taken by the people that are taking care of the person.  


Keep the patient calm, comfortable, and free from emotional upset


Avoid contamination from saliva and broken skin of the patient by taking special precautions


Keep the patient in a quiet room


Keep the patient away from triggers (loud noise, intense light, and cold air) of muscle spasms and convulsions


Allow the patient to take proper sleep to control excitability


Keep the patient hydrated. 

","Complications Of Rabies
The rabies virus travels through the peripheral nervous system and targets the central nervous system (brain) which can cause neurological complications such as encephalomyelitis. This can also cause anxiety, agitation and delirium. The virus can travel back to the PNS and can attack various peripheral organs such as salivary glands. The virus can cause the complete failure of the entire nervous system which can even cause death of the infected person. All these changes can develop following complications in patients.


Seizures


Fasciculations


Psychosis


Aphasia


Autonomic instability


Paralysis


Coma


Cardiopulmonary disorders


Multiple organ failure


Cardiac arrest


Hypotension


Confusion


Paralysis of lower legs


Problems swallowing due to painful throat and voice box spasms

","Symptoms of Rheumatoid Arthritis
 
Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis tend to fluctuate. There are times when the symptoms are severe, known as ‘flares’. The symptoms might go into ‘remission’ when they become mild. Signs and symptoms include:1. Fatigue: Fatigue or the feeling of tiredness and exhaustion is the first sign of RA which affects a person’s everyday routine and productivity.2. Fever: Fatigue is followed by a rise in temperature which further leads to a feeling of sickness and exhaustion.3. Loss of weight: Occurrence of fever and fatigue results in the loss of appetite and this can lead to weight loss and weakness. 4. Pain and stiffness: Pain and stiffness are first felt in the smaller joints like joints of the fingers or the toes. The intensity of these symptoms increases over time. The pain often lasts for several days and is followed by a gradual stiffness in the body. This stiffness intensifies after periods of inactivity for eg.after getting up from sleep in the morning.5. Swelling: Swollen hands and feet are the most common signs of rheumatoid arthritis. The inflammation in the joints causes the lining of the joints to thicken, leading to excess production of fluids in the joints. This excess fluid production puts pressure on the area surrounding the joints, leading to irritation of the nerve endings and pain and swelling of the joints. ",,"Causes Of Rheumatoid Arthritis
 
The immune system safeguards the body from infections and diseases by producing antibodies. However, sometimes antibodies tend to attack the thin layer that covers the joints. This thin layer becomes inflamed and affects the surrounding bones, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, resulting in rheumatoid arthritis.Genes play a role in causing rheumatoid arthritis. They make us vulnerable to infections caused by certain viruses and bacteria. This sometimes triggers the development of autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. ",,,,"Specialist To Visit 
Early detection of rheumatoid arthritis helps in getting better treatment and in preventing damage to the joints. Specialists who will make the perfect diagnosis and prescribe the right treatment are:


Rheumatologist


General physician


Orthopaedist


Orthopedic surgeon


A rheumatologist specializes in arthritis, hence, is the ideal doctor to consult.If not a rheumatologist, one may also consult a general physician who has treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis and who can also work closely with a rheumatologist. It is essential to consult a rheumatologist periodically as they will prescribe blood tests,joint scans, MRIs, or X-rays to inspect the joints and a suitable treatment based on the study.If the symptoms intensify, consultation from an orthopedist or an orthopedic surgeon can also be considered. Orthopedic surgeons specialize in joint replacement surgery. So, if the damage to the joints is severe and is hampering your daily life, they will recommend surgery, or any other treatment, as per requirement. Seek advice from our world-class medical professionals in case of any symptoms. Consult Now!","Treatment Of Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis has no cure. However, an early diagnosis can help in selecting a treatment to keep the symptoms under control. Some medications, such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), work in slowing down the progression of the disease and saving the joints from damage.There are three methods of treating rheumatoid arthritis related pain and symptoms:
A. Medications
These are given depending upon the intensity of the symptoms and the progression of the disease. 1. NSAIDs: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prescribed for reducing pain and inflammation. NSAIDs, like ibuprofen, are available as an over the counter drug, but for stronger NSAIDs, a doctor’s prescription is needed. 2. DMARDs: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) slow down the progression of this disease. This action helps save the joints and tissues from damage and disability.


Methotrexate: It is an immunosuppressant. It slows the activity of the body’s immune system and reduces pain, swelling, and stiffness.

Leflunomide: It blocks the chemical messengers that cause inflammation and swelling. 

Hydroxychloroquine: It eases the progression of the disease and reduces pain, swelling, and redness. 

Sulfasalazine: It suppresses the overactivity of the immune system and blocks the chemical messengers that cause inflammation. 

3. Steroids: Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and damage to the joints and provide relief from pain. These drugs have specific side effects, such as weight gain, diabetes, and thinning of the bones. Therefore, they are prescribed for a short duration and the dose is decreased gradually. Prednisone is one such corticosteroid that is prescribed to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 4. Biological DMRADs: These are some of the latest DMARDs that are prescribed for swelling and redness. These are also known as biologic response modifiers. They block the chemical messengers that cause inflammation and give relief from swelling and redness. This category includes drugs like:


Rituximab: This drug works by targeting the unwanted activity of immune cells (B cells) in rheumatoid arthritis.

Abatacept: It blocks the action of certain chemical messengers that are responsible for inflammation, swelling, and redness associated with certain joint diseases.

Tocilizumab: This is an anti interleukin-6 (IL-6) medication. IL-6 plays a key role in driving the inflammation that is responsible for joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis.

Anakinra: Interleukin-1(IL-1) is another important chemical messenger responsible for the development of RA. This drug works by blocking interleukin-1.

5. Anti-TNF drugs: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of RA. Some anti-TNF drugs which can be used in this condition are: 

Infliximab
Etanercept
Adalimumab

6. Targeted synthetic DMARDs: If the conventional DMARDs and the biological agents do not work, then targeted synthetic DMARDs are prescribed. Take these as per the doctor’s prescription to notice their effect. Doctors can also advise regular blood tests to monitor the liver, kidneys, and blood count. Examples of these drugs include:

Bariticinib
Tofacitinib
Upacitinib

B. Therapy
Physical or occupational therapy helps improve flexibility and eases joint pain. A therapist may teach ways to simplify tasks and to reduce mental and physical strain and stress. They may also guide in selecting gadgets that don’t strain the painful joints.
C. Surgery
It is advised when medications and therapy fail to slow the damage. It improves the functioning of joints and restores one’s ability to lead a productive life. A rheumatologist will advise some of the following procedures:




Tendon repair: This consists of repairing the tendons around the joints.


Synovectomy: It’s a surgery to remove the inflamed lining of the joints.


Joint fusion (arthrodesis): Fusing of two or more bones in a joint to get relief from pain.


Total joint replacement surgery: It consists of removing the damaged parts of the joint and replacing them with a metallic or plastic prosthesis.



",,"Home-care For Rheumatoid Arthritis
Although painkillers help ease the pain and the inflammation, there is no cure for this condition. Therefore, making lifestyle changes, dietary changes, and managing stress are crucial in reducing the discomfort and slowing down the progress of the disease. Here are a few changes that will provide relief and help live a comfortable life:
1. Home remedies
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves inflammation; therefore, adding anti-inflammatory herbs and spices will have health benefits. However, these should be taken after consulting a healthcare provider. These herbs include:


Turmeric (haldi): This golden spice has anti-inflammatory properties and analgesic (pain relieving) effects. 

Ginger (adrak): It has anti-inflammatory properties and may improve RA symptoms by affecting the expression of certain genes.

Green tea: It is rich in antioxidants. It can help reduce inflammation and can protect joints.op

Cinnamon (chakla): This ancient spice is filled with antioxidants that can prove beneficial for tender and swollen joints.

Garlic (lehsun): This spice can liven up any meal and has anti-inflammatory properties that reduce cytokines (known to cause inflammation) and relieve pain due to RA.

Black Pepper (kalimirch):  This simple and household spice has antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and gastro-protective effects. 

Willow bark: This spice has significant anti-inflammatory properties and reduces various markers of inflammation.

Indian frankincense: It is derived from the bark of the Boswellia tree, which has strong anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic properties.

Ashwagandha: It is also called Indian ginseng and is known to ease pain and joint swelling in people with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the supplement can cause an additive effect if taken with diabetes or thyroid medications. Hence, do not consume it without consulting a physician. Moreover, pregnant women should talk to their doctors before taking ashwagandha.

2. Physical activity
This is the most important and effective way of reducing pain and discomfort associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Tailor an exercise program according to the schedule and health benefits that are needed with the help of a doctor or physiotherapist. Half an hour of physical activity every day is enough to increase stamina and flexibility. This will also improve one’s sleep pattern and will ease depression and anxiety related to rheumatoid arthritis. 
3. Dietary changes
Make informed choices about diet with the help of a nutritionist to not just reduce weight but to also improve the overall health. The necessary nutrients supplied through a tailored diet will improve one’s energy levels as their weight decreases. Having a well-balanced diet rich in antioxidants can lessen the pressure on the joints and give comfort from pain. Make sure to consult a doctor or dietician before starting any supplements. The food or supplements rich in the following can be beneficial:




Omega-3 fatty acids


Zinc


Iron


Folate


B vitamins


Calcium


Vitamin D 


Fluoride




4. Sleep
It is of utmost importance in one’s fight against any disease. Eight hours of sound sleep every night helps maintain a positive mindset and also eases pain. Consult a doctor if you have difficulty sleeping. Also try taking short naps in the afternoon to energize you for the remaining part of the day.
5. Massage
Massages increase the fresh oxygenated blood supply to the muscles and organs and aid in removal of waste products from the body, which alleviate rheumatic disorders. It also improves flexibility and reduces soreness of the joints.Castor oil or essential oils, like black currant seed, evening primrose, lemongrass, and borage seed, can be used for massages. However, they should be used only after testing on your skin to ensure there is no irritation.
6. Heat and cold
Ice packs help bring down the swelling and the inflammation. One can use them during the flares but only for 15 minutes. Alternately, use a hot water bag or a warm towel to relax the muscles and to increase blood flow to the treatment area. Hot tub baths also provide relaxation to stiff, painful muscles."

","Symptoms Of Rickets
 
Rickets is described as the weakening and softening of bones, which is caused by prolonged lack of exposure to Vitamin D. Look out for the following rickets symptoms in your child to get quick and effective treatment.

1. Fragile bones

A symptom that is commonly associated with rickets and severe calcium and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to very weak bones, increasing the risk of fractures. Your child could have fragile bones, if they suffer from fractures frequently.

2. Pain in the spine and legs

Due to the bones being soft and weak, they become sore, making it very painful for a child. This might make your child reluctant to walk, so they may waddle and tire easily after a few steps.

3. Teeth problems

A child with rickets may show abnormalities in teeth structure, holes in the enamel, increasing cavities, and delay in teeth growth and formation. Good dental care helps your children develop good dental habits. Read more about how to manage dental problems in children.Click To Know More!
4. Skeletal deformities
When your child’s body has a deficiency in the required nutrients, rickets lead to many skeletal abnormalities. These include bowed legs or rickets leg, which refers to a curve in the spine, protruding breastbone, an oddly shaped skull, and pelvic deformities. Nutritional rickets usually presents in infancy or preschool age, usually as widened wrists or bowing of legs.

5. Retarded growth and development

Delay in the development of bones and growth can lead to your child having short stature and stunted growth. 

6. Craniotabes

This is a disorder where the bones of the skull are soft, and the fontanels are wide. This is frequently seen in infants who are older than three months. 

7. Rachitic chest

In this case, a child is seen with a wide costochondral junction, which is the joint between the ribs, and Harrison’s groove, a depression at the lower side of the rib cage that develops when the diaphragm pulls the soft ribcage.A condition known as rachitic rosary can result in the thickening caused by nodules forming on the costochondral joints. This appears as a visible bump in the middle of each rib in a line on each side of the body. This somewhat resembles a rosary, giving rise to its name.

8. Hypocalcemia

Defined as low calcium levels in the blood, infants with hypocalcemia may show signs and symptoms such as muscle spasms and convulsions. ","Causes Of Rickets
 
Rickets is a bone disorder in children that leads to weak bones, muscle pain, and skeletal deformities. Today, nutritional rickets or rickets caused by the deficiency of Vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus are the most common bone diseases affecting children. But other than this, rickets can be caused by genetics, drugs, or lack of mineralization. These are the common types of rickets caused due to several deficiencies. These include:

1. Calcipenic rickets
This is the most common form of rickets, along with Vitamin D deficiency that is reported in children. This type of rickets develops due to a deficiency of calcium in the body. This can occur due to trouble in absorbing calcium seen in diseases such as celiac diseases. 

2. Phosphopenic rickets
As the name suggests, this type of rickets is caused by the deficiency of phosphorus in your body. This can not only be due to low intake of phosphorus-rich food but also due to factors such as problems in phosphorus absorption by the intestine or high renal loss. 

3. Vitamin D-dependent rickets

Vitamin D-dependent rickets is the most common type of rickets that children all over the world suffer from. This is the type of rickets caused by the deficiency of Vitamin D. This can be due to problems in the synthesis of Vitamin D, a defect in the Vitamin D receptor, low consumption of Vitamin D-rich food, and low exposure to sunlight.

4. Genetics
Other than the lack of nutrients in the body, rickets can also be genetic in nature. This is attributed to the genetic mutation of certain genes that stop the synthesis of Vitamin D in the body. 

5. Familial hypophosphatemic rickets
This is the most commonly inherited form of refractory rickets, being inherited as X-linked dominant with variable penetrance. Sporadic instances are frequent and an autosomal recessive inheritance has also been reported. The gene responsible for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets is termed as PHEX gene (phosphate regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the X chromosome)
6. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA)
Proximal or RTA are important causes of refractory rickets in children. The conditions are characterized by hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with normal blood levels of urea and creatinine. Patients with proximal RTA may show low levels of phosphate, aminoaciduria (amino acids in the urine), and proteinuria (proteins in the urine). The use of bicarbonate and phosphate supplementation results in the healing of rickets.

7. Chronic kidney disease
Refractory rickets may occasionally be the presenting manifestation of chronic kidney disease. The features of the mineral bone disease depend on the patient's age and duration of disease. Elevated blood levels of creatinine, phosphate, and parathormone are characteristic. Therapy consists of restricting phosphate intake and providing supplements of calcium and active Vitamin D analogs.
8. Oncogenic rickets
Mesenchymal tumors may secrete fibroblast growth factors that result in phosphaturia (phosphates in urine), hypophosphatemia (low level of phosphorous), rickets, and muscle weakness.

9. Secondary to other diseases


McCune-Albright syndrome: It is a disorder in which the bones, skin and several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues are affected.


Epidermal nevus syndrome: The presence of skin lesions known as epidermal nevi that are associated with additional extra-cutaneous abnormalities, affecting the brain, eye, and skeletal systems.


Dent's disease: It is a chronic kidney disorder that causes, kidney problems as a result of damage to the structures called proximal tubules.

For the treatment of rickets, a diet rich in Vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus can help. Other treatment options include:

1. Surgery

Deformed bones due to rickets can be treated without surgery. However, in severe cases, surgery may be the only option to correct severely bowed legs, among other bone deformities. Chest or pelvic deformities and growth retardation may be permanent and can not be treated through surgery.

2. Stoss therapy

In this type of treatment, a single large dose of Vitamin D is administered orally or intramuscularly for infants less than a month old. Oral treatment is advised because it restores Vitamin D levels quickly. This regimen is generally both safe and effective in treating Vitamin D deficiency rickets. 

3. Multiple doses of Vitamin D

In this regimen, small, daily doses of Vitamin D are given depending on the age of the child. The daily dose for infants less than a month old, 1-12 months, more than 12 months are 1000 IU, 1000 – 5000 IU, and 5000 IU, respectively, for a period of 2 to 3 months. Eventually, a dose of 400 IU is recommended for daily consumption.

4. Calcium and phosphate supplements

For rickets resulting from genetics, treatment by a pediatric endocrinologist and orthopedic specialist is suggested. For Vitamin D-dependent rickets, children are treated with high doses of calcitriol and calcium. If your child is diagnosed with familial hypophosphatemic rickets, oral administration of phosphate supplements along with Vitamin D is prescribed as treatment. ","Home-care For Rickets
Doctors have pointed out that diet plays an incredibly important role in the prevention and treatment of rickets. Follow these steps to fight rickets: 


You must give your child 400 IU/day of vitamin D supplementation to fight Vitamin D-dependent rickets.


If your child is still on breastmilk, completely or partially, 400 IU/day Vitamin D should be introduced into the diet until he/she starts receiving at least 1 liter of formula per day.


Your child should be given 400 IU/day of Vitamin D, if he/she is receiving less than 1 liter of formula per day and is not consuming mother’s milk.


Include foods such as milk, yogurt, cheese, meat, and fish to help increase the levels of Vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus levels.


If your child is lactose intolerant, you can give orange juice or soy milk as both contain high concentrations of Vitamin D.


When you hear calcium, all you can think of is a glass of milk. However, there’s much more to calcium than just milk and milk products. Read more about calcium-rich foods and supplements.Click Here!","Complications Of Rickets
Rickets caused due to deficiency of calcium may lead to a child getting seizures, breathing problems, and cramps. But in the long run, it can lead to serious complications, including complications like:


Short stature 


Multiple bone fractures


Pneumonia  (lungs become filled with fluid)


Dental hypoplasia (poor formation of enamel))


Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle where the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood to the muscle)


Hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in the cavities of the brain)


Seizures


Cavities in the teeth


Irregularities in the bones

Skin folds.


Areas prone to sweating like armpits and back.


Flexures like underbust, armpits, and groin.


Areas between the fingers and toes get affected, especially in the rainy season.


Depending upon the affected body site by the fungi, ringworm can be classified into following types:


Tinea capitis: It occurs on the scalp causing itchiness and loss of hair.

Tinea barbae: This is when the infection affects the beard area.

Tinea manuum: It occurs on the hands or in between the fingers.

Tinea cruris: Also known as jock itch, this infection affects the groin area due to excessive sweating and poor hygiene.

Tinea pedis: Commonly known as athlete’s foot, it affects the feet and is commonly found between the toes.

Tinea unguium: Also known as onychomycosis, this fungal infection affects the nails and nail plates causing them to deform and break easily.

Tinea corporis: This affects the torso, back and upper portions of the limbs. 

Tinea imbricata: Another variant of tinea corporis and is recognized clinically by its distinct, scaly plaques arranged in concentric rings.

Tinea incognito: This is tinea corporis with an altered presentation due to corticosteroid treatment.

Here’s everything you need to know about fungal skin infections.Click To Know!","Symptoms Of Ringworm
The symptoms of the ringworm depend upon the location of the body invaded by the fungi but they broadly include: 


Itchy or scaly patches that are red, brown, or grey, or raised areas of skin called plaques


Patches that develop blisters or pustules


Patches that resemble a ring with deeper colour on the outside


Patches with edges that are defined and raised


Overlapping rings


Hair loss


Depending upon the site of infections, a person may experience following clinical manifestations:
1. Feet (tinea pedis or athlete’s foot)
It is the most common type of tinea infections. It usually occurs in men and young adults but children, women, and older people can also be affected. It is characterised by: 


Red, swollen, peeling & itchy skin between the toes


Whitening of the skin between the toes


Scaling of the feet


Blisters on the foot

Pink to red round patches on the skin


Itching 


5. Nails (tinea unguium)
It is also known as onychomycosis, it is the fungal infection of the fingernails or toenails. Onychomycosis affects toenails more often than fingernails and is most common among persons who have tinea pedis. Onychomycosis is more common in older adults and in persons with vascular disease, diabetes mellitus and trauma to nails. The nails of the person infected with tinea unguium are:

7. Groin (tinea cruris)
This type of fungal infection often affects skin of the genitals that can spread to the upper inner thighs. The symptoms includes:


Rash that can be painful or painless 


Burning sensation in the groin area


Continuous itching

","Causes Of Ringworm
The causative organism behind ringworm infection is fungus. Approximately 40 different species of fungi are known to cause ringworm. Some of the common species that causes ringworm are: 


Trichophyton


Microsporum


Epidermophyton


Once the fungi attach to the outer layer of the skin, they trigger an allergic reaction causing certain blood cells like eosinophils and chemicals called histamines to rush to the infected site. These cause the characteristic itching sensation. Scratching the area causes further damage to the skin. It helps the infection spread deeper and wider.A person gets ringworm mainly from these three sources:


Humans: This is called anthropophilic transmission. It involves parasites that  prefer humans to animals. This is the most common form of transmission.


Animals: Known as zoophilic infection, this happens when animals become the preferred source of food for the fungus. The infected animal then goes on to infect a human.


Soil: Ringworm-causing fungi can also be the earth-loving variety that cause geophilic ringworm infection.

Selenium sulphide (shampoo)


Naftifine (cream or gel)


Sulconazole (cream or lotion)


Onychomycosis mostly does not respond to topical therapy although ciclopirox nail lacquer applied daily for a year is occasionally beneficial. Itraconazole and terbinafine both accumulate in the nail plate and can be used to treat onychomycosis.
Oral antifungal medications
Oral antifungal agents are prescribed in case of severe infection, failed topical treatment or immunocompromised patients. Thses are available in the form of tablets and capsules. Some of the common examples include: 


Terbinafine


Griseofulvin


Itraconazole


Fluconazole 


Surgical care
Surgical treatment is usually not indicated except for drainage of superficial vesicles, bullae, pustules, or deep abscesses.Note: Relapse of tinea cruris and tinea pedis are common and should be treated early with creams to avoid development of more extensive disease. ","Home-care For Ringworm

1. Hygiene

Ringworm is a highly contagious disease. Hence, maintaining good hygiene is necessary to prevent spreading of the infection to other parts of the body, to other people and to pets. Practising cleanliness also ensures faster recovery. The following measures can be taken to adopt a fungus free environment: 


Wash your hands with a soap and water after applying medication to the affected area.


Shower daily and after playing any sports.


Wash the belongings of the patients such as towels, clothes, and bedding in hot water.


Wear washed clothes everyday.


Keep your body and clothes clean and dry.


Disinfect your shoes regularly.


Take measures to reduce sweat.


2. Duration of treatment
Generally, antifungal medications show improvement in the lesions quickly and patients discontinue taking or applying medicines. Take the medications as per the recommendations of your doctor to avoid recurrence of the infection.

3. Consult veterinarian 

Ringworm can be spread from your pets such as dogs and cats to humans or vice versa. All the preventive measures taken by the patient and family members should be followed for the pets too. If a pet is showing any symptoms of ringworm, consult a veterinarian.

4. Keep in touch with your dermatologist 

Most of the ringworm infections often started to show improvement with the first treatment within 1 to 2 weeks. If infections persist and are not responding to the treatment, follow up with your doctor. 

5. Eat right

Diet alone cannot treat fungal infections but some food helps in speedy recovery through their anti-inflammatory properties such as:


Protein rich foods like meats, pulses & beans


Food rich in omega-3-fatty acids that includes nuts, seeds & fish


Green vegetables


Yoghourt


Garlic in the form of food 


Avoid excess sugar and processed foods as high sugar serves as a medium for the growth of fungi that may delay your recovery and healing process. ",

","Symptoms Of Rosacea

The symptoms of rosacea are complex. The appearance and pattern of symptoms vary among individuals. The symptoms often cycle between occurrence and remission when the individual does not experience any symptoms.
The condition usually affects the face but other body parts such as sides of the face, ears, neck, scalp and chest can also be involved.
The symptoms progress from having red skin of the nose and cheeks to long lasting redness. These symptoms often lead to the appearance of a rash and small blood vessels beneath the skin. 
Because of the complexity of signs and symptoms, the condition is divided into 4 subtypes. Individuals can have more than one subtype at the same time. The treatment approaches of every subtype are different. 
1. Subtype 1: Erythemato-telangiectatic rosacea (ETR)
This subtype usually affects the face. Individuals with this subtype have very sensitive skin. The classical symptoms include:


Persistent redness of the central face 


Telangiectasia (visible blood vessels on the face)


Stinging and burning sensation on the skin


Dry skin


Swollen skin


Scaling 


Tendency to blush more easily 


Increased sensitivity to skin



2. Subtype 2: Papulopustular rosacea
The most common symptom of this subtype is the appearance of acne like breakouts. The spots resemble acne but there are no blackheads and white-heads. The breakouts do not remain permanently and usually come and go. This type is more common in middle aged females.
Most of the symptoms are the same as type 1. The other distinguishing symptoms include: 


Papules (solid raised spots on the skin)


Pustules (small, inflamed pus filled lesions on the skin)


Plaques (raised scaly patches on the skin)


Oily skin



3. Subtype 3: Phymatous rosacea
This subtype primarily affects the nose but may also involve chin, forehead, ears, and eyelids. It is mainly characterized by the thickening of skin.
This subtype is rare and include the following symptoms: 


Bumpy texture of the skin


Larger pores on the skin


Oily skin


Thickened skin on the chin, forehead, cheeks and ears


Rhinophyma (thickening of the skin of the nose)



4. Subtype 4: Ocular rosacea
This subtype affects the eye and individual can have one or more of the following symptoms:


Bloodshot or watery appearance


Feeling of having sand in the eyes


Burning/stinging sensation in the eyes


Dry eyes


Itching in the eyes


Increased sensitivity to light


Blurred vision


Visible broken blood vessels on an eyelid


Cyst on the eyelid

",,"Causes Of Rosacea
 
The exact cause of rosacea is not known. While the causes of inflammation are not fully understood, the following theories have been postulated:
1. Genes
Some theories suggest the role of genes in developing rosacea and making some individuals more prone to skin inflammation.
2. Alterations in immunity (first line of defense)
Our body has a natural immunity against disease causing microbes. This immunity is provided by specific chemicals, which are released after stimulation of receptors present on the skin.Individuals with rosacea have an increased expression of these receptors, leading to elevated levels of specific chemicals which trigger skin inflammation even in the absence of any microbes. 
3. Ultraviolet  (UV) light
Both UVA and UVB light contribute to the development of rosacea by triggering the inflammatory cascade mentioned above. 
4. Abnormalities in the blood vessels
Triggers such as sun rays may be responsible for the degeneration of the elastic tissue of the skin and dilation of blood vessels of the face. This may cause rosacea symptoms such as flushing, persistent redness and visible broken blood vessels. 
5. Triggers that initiate inflammation
External triggers such as ultraviolet rays (UV), spicy food, alcohol, exercise, and stress may stimulate the immune system and nerves to cause dilation of blood vessels. This can lead to inflammation and redness seen in rosacea.
6. Role of mites and bacteria
Mites known as demodex folliculorum live harmlessly on the skin of human beings. However, studies suggest that these mites are present in large numbers in rosacea patients. Other microbes that may cause rosacea is Staphylococcus epidermidis. This bacteria is not found on normal skin and triggers an immune response that may cause rosacea. H.pylori, a bacteria known to cause gastritis, gastric cancer, and gastrointestinal ulcers is also known to be associated with rosacea. 
7. Defective skin barrier
A defective skin barrier function can also lead to symptoms of inflammation, redness, and blisters that are characteristic of rosacea. ","Diagnosis Of Rosacea
 
There is no specific diagnostic test for rosacea. Diagnosis is usually made after a physical examination of the skin and eyes. The patients are also asked about any potential triggers, symptoms, and medical history. 
In some cases, medical tests are performed to rule out the presence of any other disease with resembling symptoms such as lupus and allergic skin reaction.
Are Rosacae and Psoriasis the same?
While rosacea and psoriasis can both be caused by genetic and age-related factors, they are different conditions. Rosacea usually causes flushing which is limited to the face. In severe cases, acne and thickened skin can be seen in rosacea. On the other hand, psoriasis usually causes red, scaly plaques on the entire body, amongst other symptoms.

The treatment approach of rosacea depends upon its type and symptoms and is individualized for every patient. The following points are taken into consideration before initiating treatment:


Symptoms 


Triggers


Patient’s wish of the appearance


Psychological aspect


1. Goals of the treatment


Easing the discomfort 


Preventing rosacea from worsening


Due to the multiple symptoms observed in rosacea, there is a stepwise approach to combat them. It includes: 
 
Step 1: Controlling the inflammatory lesions through anti-inflammatory medications and antibiotics
Step 2: Getting rid of the blood vessels using laser technology
Step 3: Minimizing the background redness by using brimonidine The best treatment outcome is offered by a combination of the following therapies:
2. Topical therapies
These are the first line of therapy and are available in the form of cream, gel, and ointments. The medications that are given via topical therapy include anti-inflammatory medications and antibiotics.  US-FDA approved topical agents include:


Azelaic acid


Metronidazole


Sodium sulfacetamide 


Brimonidine 


 
Other topical medications include:


Retinoids like adapalene, tretinoin 


Calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus and pimecrolimus


Macrolides like erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin 


Benzoyl peroxide


Permethrin 


Ivermectin


Clindamycin


Oxymetazoline 


Minocycline


Tranexamic acid


Note: Ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion is usually recommended for ocular rosacea.
3. Oral therapies
Oral therapies are generally used in combinations to treat moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea. 
 US-FDA-approved oral medications include:


Tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline 


Other oral medications include:

Macrolides like erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin
Beta- blockers like Carvedilol and propranolol
Isotretinoin
Oral Ivermectin

4. Laser and light-based therapy
Some clinical symptoms of rosacea such as telangiectasias, persistent facial erythema, and phymas (especially rhinophyma) do not respond well to the above-mentioned approaches. 
Lasers and light-based therapies are used to destroy the dilated blood vessels present in the superficial skin. Commonly used lasers include:


Intense pulsed light laser


Pulsed dye laser


Potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser


Diode laser


Ablative laser


5. Surgery
It is used rarely to remove the thickened skin in phymatous rosacea. The skin is excised with razor blades and tangential excisions using scalpel under either local or general anesthesia.Radiofrequency ablation (uses heat to target the affected tissue) is very effective in the treatment of rhinophyma. It has a better safety profile than lasers as it produces less heat in the tissues. 
Injectables are also used to treat severe rosacea, resistant to topical and oral medications.Examples include:


Intradermal botulinum toxin 


Secukinumab

","Symptoms Of Scabies 

If you have had scabies before, signs and symptoms may develop within a few days of exposure. If you’ve never had scabies, it can take as long as six weeks for signs and symptoms to begin. A person may have scabies if the following symptoms are present:
 


A severe itching sensation in the affected areas of the skin that usually worsens at night.


Rash or bumps on the skin with a burrow-like appearance.


Although scabies can affect any part of the skin, common sites of infestation are - armpits, between fingers, inner elbows, around the waist, scalp, palms, soles of feet, etc.


Occasionally, there may be scaly patches on the skin that resemble eczema.


A severe type of scabies, called Norwegian scabies, leads to the formation of thick crusts on the skin.


NOTE: In infants and young children, common sites of infestation usually include the scalp , palms of hand, and soles of feet.


","Causes Of Scabies 

Scabies is not an infection. It is an infestation that occurs due to an 8-legged mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. This mite can enter your skin through direct human-to-human contact with a person with scabies or by sharing personal items, such as bed sheets, towels, linen, etc.
Once the mite comes in contact with human skin, it starts burrowing into the skin’s upper layer and lays eggs. The eggs hatch in a couple of days and develop into adult mites within two to three weeks and spread to other parts of the body.
A severe infestation of scabies known as crusted scabies or Norwegian scabies occurs when the mites and eggs are present in huge numbers. This condition is seen in people with poor or weakened immune systems.


","Risk Factors For Scabies

The following conditions increase the risk of contracting scabies -


Living in close proximity to people in overcrowded places, such as nursing homes, prisons, daycare centers, etc.


Sexual relationships with multiple partners.


Sharing toiletries, bed sheets, linen, etc., with other people in the surroundings.




","Diagnosis Of Scabies

The physician takes a detailed history of the onset of symptoms and performs a thorough physical examination to identify the site and type of skin lesions. Usually, the close contacts of the person are also examined to check for the spread of scabies.
 
Scabies can be confirmed by the following tests -


Microscopic examination of a skin scraping


Direct visualization of magnified skin lesions or Dermatoscopy


Burrow ink test to evaluate the burrowing lesions of scabies


Routine laboratory tests or imaging studies play very little role in establishing a diagnosis of scabies. Occasionally, if a patient presents with crusted lesions or Norwegian scabies, routine laboratory tests like Complete Blood Count (CBC) may be performed to get a general idea of the person’s health and immunity status.


","Specialist To Visit

It is essential to seek prompt medical care in presence of symptoms, such as severe itching which worsens at night especially, accompanied by rashes, or other characteristic skin lesions like burrows. A dermatologist and general physician can diagnose and treat scabies.

",,"Home Care For Scabies

It may take 4-8 weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after coming into contact with the mite. As the symptoms start to appear, the severity of the itching sensation starts increasing. Care must be taken to avoid scratching the skin aggressively as it may lead to further irritation, breaking, and bleeding in the skin. 

Application of topical emollient creams and lotions may help the sensation of severe itching subside. 

Apply the medicine all over your body from the neck to the toes. Take a bath before applying the prescribed lotions.


As scabies is a highly contagious disease, special care must be taken to break the transmission chain and prevent others around you from getting infected. 


It is advisable to seek anti-scabies treatment for all close contacts simultaneously. 


At the same time, it is necessary to thoroughly wash all items of personal nature, such as clothes, towels, bed sheets, etc., that you have used in the three days preceding scabies treatment.


 ","Complications Of Scabies

Scabies infestation leads to a severe itching sensation. If the patient does not refrain from scratching aggressively, it may lead to breaking of the skin, which can result in secondary bacterial infection.
 
Crusted scabies or Norwegian scabies is a type of severe scabies that affects those with weaker immune systems such as HIV patients. There may be millions of scabies mites affecting larger areas and causing a crusty appearance of the skin. Crusted scabies is highly contagious and resistant to treatment.


","Alternative Therapies For Scabies

Ayurveda: Ayurvedic formulations, such as lotions, creams, soaps, etc., made from naturally-occurring substances, such as tea tree oil, aloe vera gel, neem oil, camphor oil, eucalyptus oil, turmeric, etc., may provide symptomatic relief to patients with scabies.These herbal remedies are known for their medicinal properties, and they also give a soothing effect when applied to the skin, reducing the itching sensation.
If you are suffering from scabies, you may get symptomatic relief by applying tea tree oil or aloe vera gel directly to the lesions. You can bathe with soaps made from neem oil extract or eucalyptus oil extract as they are known for their antimicrobial action. 


","Living With Scabies

Constant itching can considerably hamper the quality of life of a scabies patient. Scabies itch usually worsens at night, and this may disturb the sleep schedule of the patient and leave them feeling restless and tired.There is also a risk of transmission of scabies from one person to another. Thus, a scabies patient needs to take considerable precautions to avoid the disease transmission. This is especially important if the scabies patient is living in close proximity with other persons in confined spaces.It is understandable that scabies can lead to isolation and lot of frustration. Proper medical treatment with psyclological support from family and friends can help the patient overcome the condition.

Symptoms Of Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, behaves, and interacts with his/her surroundings. Symptoms such as mood changes, alterations in behavior, altered thinking, and abnormal social functioning often appear gradually before a major episode of psychosis or hallucinations. The symptoms of Schizophrenia can vary in type and severity over time, with alternating periods of worsening of symptoms and remission in symptoms.
The symptoms of Schizophrenia can be broadly classified into the following subtypes:
1. Psychotic symptoms


Delusions: False beliefs with no base in reality, even when there is evidence to the contrary. For example, a person with schizophrenia has thoughts such as someone out there wants to hurt him/her even when no such threat exists.


Hallucinations: Hearing, seeing, or feeling things that do not exist. For a person with schizophrenia, these altered experiences feel absolutely real.


Abnormal or disorganized behavior: A person with schizophrenia may behave abnormally, and the behavior spectrum can range from childlike silliness to unpredictable rage and agitation.


Abnormal motor behavior: A person with schizophrenia often does not make eye contact, lacks facial expressions, makes bizarre postures and unnecessary or excessive movements.


Disordered thinking and speech: Often people with schizophrenia are unable to communicate effectively and may use meaningless words or out-of-context replies to questions.



2. Negative symptoms

These are symptoms that affect a person's ability to function normally. In this, a person may typically -

Neglect personal hygiene
Lose interest in everyday activities 
Lack the ability to experience pleasure in everyday life
Show reduced ability to express emotions
Be unable to effectively communicate thoughts and struggle to frame words.


3. Cognitive symptoms
This subset of symptoms affects memory, concentration, and attention. This includes: 

Difficulties in processing information to make decisions
Learning new things
Remembering information
",,"
Causes Of Schizophrenia

There is no single established cause of schizophrenia. It is likely to occur due to a complex interaction between genetic factors (such as having a family history) and certain alterations in brain structure and function. Environmental factors, such as exposure to certain toxins, neuro-viruses, substance abuse or stressful surroundings, may also contribute to the condition.",,,"
Treatment Of Schizophrenia

Treatment with antipsychotic medications can help alleviate symptoms and reduce the chances of unexpected complications. Lifelong treatment is essential even if the symptoms seem less or controlled.
The medications consist primarily of first or second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Other medications such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs, or a combination of these drugs are also used to treat this condition.
1. Conventional antipsychotics or first-generation antipsychotics: Also known as typical antipsychotics or first-generation antipsychotics, these drugs help to control psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia such as delusions and hallucinations. They work by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. They can potentially cause frequent and significant neurological side effects such as movement disorders. They are significantly cheaper than the newer second-generation antipsychotics and this may be an important consideration in long-term treatment.Examples include:


Chlorpromazine


Haloperidol


Fluphenazine


2. Atypical antipsychotics or second generation antipsychoticsThese are newer antipsychotic medicines with fewer body movement-related side effects but can affect other body mechanisms contributing to their side effect profile than the traditional first-generation antipsychotic medications. They work by blocking the receptors for neurotransmitters like serotonin (stronger blocking) and dopamine (moderate blocking). Common examples are:


Aripiprazole


Ziprasidone


Sulpiride


Asenapine


Clozapine


3. Long-acting injectable antipsychoticsCertain formulations of typical or atypicals are also available as long-acting intramuscular injections that need to be given every 2-4 weeks. This is useful in patients who are resistant to taking daily pills and can help with adherence.
4. Nutritional supplementsTaking Vitamin B Complex and Omega-3 fatty acid supplements like fish oil capsules can help ease the symptoms in Schizophrenic patients. Vitamin B complex is essential for normal functioning of the nervous system. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements contain DHA and other fatty acids which are important for brain health.",,"Living With Schizophrenia
Living with someone who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia may be challenging for the family and the caregivers as the patient needs constant care and support. However, here are a few tips that can help you to take care of someone with the condition.
1. Understand the condition
Understanding and accepting what your family member or relative is going through is the first step in managing the disease. Information about the condition will help the caregivers understand the importance of therapy and recognize warning signs if the disease worsens. 
2. Stay focused on goals of therapyThe therapy goals are different for each patient and are adjusted to suit individual requirements. Managing the condition is an ongoing process. Help your loved ones adjust to the therapy and encourage them to take responsibility towards their goals.
3. Help the patient abstain from vices
Alcohol and recreational drugs worsen the symptoms of Schizophrenia and make the condition difficult to treat. Hence, the family or caregivers need to ensure that the patient does not indulge in such activities.
4. Try relaxation and stress management techniques
It is not unusual for the family or caregivers to be stressed and anxious along with the patient themselves. Learning relaxation techniques and stress management will help cope with the disease.
5. Join schizophrenia support groups
Connecting with other people facing similar challenges may help a person come to terms with the disease. There are a few societies in India working in the field of mental health and wellness, offering support to those diagnosed with life-changing mental health disorders like schizophrenia.

Mental illnesses are quite common these days. Just being there with someone who needs help is one of the simple ways to help a patient. Need more help? Here are 6 ways you can help your loved ones struggling with mental illness.Click To Read","

","Symptoms Of Sciatica

The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve that branches from the lower back through your hips, buttocks, and down each leg. Sciatica presents itself with pain along the pathway of the nerve, including the lower back, buttock, and the back of the thigh and calf. The symptoms include:



Unilateral leg pain


Pain in the lower back


Radiating pain to foot or toes


Numbness and burning in the distribution of the nerve


Increased pain in keeping the lag straight


Decreased range of motion of the hip joint.

","Causes Of Sciatica
Sciatica symptoms occur when there is pathology anywhere along the course of the nerves. Sciatica develops in many ways; among them, the most common are the following:



Herniated discs: This condition occurs when the soft center of a spinal disc pushes through a crack in the more rigid exterior casing of the spine.





Degenerative disc disease: It is a natural aging process that acts as a precursor to disc herniation.





Lumbar (lower back) spinal stenosis: It is the narrowing of the sciatic nerve





Isthmic spondylolisthesis: This condition results from the vertebra slipping forward on the sacral, pinching the nerve root as it leaves the spine.





Piriformis syndrome: This occurs when your piriformis muscle (muscle in the gluteal region of the lower limbs) compresses the sciatic nerve and results in swelling and redness.





Malignancy (cancer): Metastatic (spreading) bone or soft tissue cancer, sciatic nerve cancer, hemangioblastoma (type of brain tumor)





Infection: That can lead to abscess formation and inflammation of the disc.





Vascular compression: Compression of the blood vessels can lead to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm (occurs when blood walls of the blood vessels are injured).





Bony compression: Overgrowth of bones in the sciatic nerve distribution can put pressure on it.





Gynecological cause: Studies have shown that uterine fibroid and endometriosis (overgrowth of the inner lining of the uterus) can also cause sciatica.

Sciatica may be caused due to reasons related to the disc or non-discogenic causes. However, your chances of getting sciatica increase with the following factors:

Age
As you age, the changes in your spine can lead to bony overgrowths and herniated discs, the most common causes of sciatica.

Genetic predisposition
Studies suggest that lumbar disc disorders, characterized by disc herniation, have a vital genetic component that can lead to sciatica.
Occupation
Particularly if associated with physical activity, especially flexion/torsion of the trunk, arms frequently raised above shoulder height, and driving motor vehicles.

Incorrect walking posture
While walking, your shoulders should be back, down, and relaxed, as improper posture can compress your lumbar discs and cause sciatic nerve irritation.

Jogging
It can predispose you to pain if you have a history of back or lumbar problems. Research shows that joggers have a lower risk for incidental sciatic pain but a higher risk for persistent symptoms.

Smoking
Studies demonstrate that smoking is a modest risk factor for lumbar pain and clinically verified sciatica.

The infection might occur anywhere in the body, but some of the common sites where infection could lead to sepsis include:The lungs: Lung infections such as pneumonia might lead to sepsis in some patients. Sepsis through the lungs can be fatal if not treated on time.The abdomen: An infection in the appendix (appendicitis), infection of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis), gallbladder infections, liver infections, or bowel problems might lead to mild or severe sepsis.The urinary tract: An infection in the kidneys or bladder can also lead to sepsis. This kind of blood infection occurs mostly in patients who have a urinary catheter to drain urine. Urosepsis might cause nausea, vomiting, pain in your lower spine, and abnormal white blood cell count (either too high or too low). Urosepsis can be life-threatening if not treated on time. Read more about urinary tract infections (UTIs).Click Now!The skin: Sometimes bacteria might penetrate the skin through open cuts or wounds.

 ","Treatment Of Sepsis
Immediate and aggressive treatment increases the chances of survival in sepsis. Treatment in time is essential to prevent a septic shock. Patients with sepsis require lifesaving measures such as oxygen and breathing machines. The following treatment options are adopted to stabilize patients with sepsis symptoms. They include:
A. Antibiotics 
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initially given as they are effective against a wide variety of bacteria. After conducting all the relevant blood tests, antibiotics targeting particular bacterias that are causing the infection are given. These antibiotics include:1. Ceftriaxone (Rocephin): It is used to control several life-threatening bacterial infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and E. coli. It is also given to prevention of infection or sepsis after surgery.2. Meropenem (Merrem): It is an intravenous antibiotic used to treat sepsis arising out of intra-abdominal infections.3. Cefotaxime (Claforan): It is an intravenous antibiotic used to treat sepsis that may arise from a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, meningitis, or cellulitis. 4. Ampicillin and sulbactam (Unasyn): This combination treats a wide spectrum of bacterial infections that might include skin sepsis.5. Levofloxacin (Levaquin): This antibiotic is used to treat bacterial infections in the kidney and prostate. It is also used to treat skin infections and pneumonia.
B. Intravenous fluids
Intravenous fluids are administered as soon as possible to prevent severe sepsis or septic shock. Crystalloid fluids are the most commonly used intravenous solutions given to patients with sepsis and septic shock.
C. Vasopressors
If the blood pressure doesn’t increase even after intravenous fluids, vasopressor medications are started. The function of vasopressors is to constrict the blood vessels to increase blood pressure. Norepinephrine and dopamine are the most preferred vasopressors used in the treatment of sepsis or septic shock.
D. Supportive care
Supportive care includes oxygen, a machine to help breathe properly, and dialysis if the kidneys are adversely affected.
E. Surgery
Surgery might be considered if the source of the infection is pus (abscesses), dead tissues (gangrene), or infected tissues. If there is a soft tissue abscess leading to sepsis, it should be drained as soon as possible. ",,"Home-Care For Sepsis 
Sepsis is life-threatening for all age groups, but it is potentially dangerous for infants and older people. Sepsis can be treated with early diagnosis and proper treatment. But sepsis has several long-term side effects, which require special care even after discharge from the hospital. Therefore, home care is an important part of the recovery from sepsis. Follow certain measures to look after your loved one at home:
1. Complete the antibiotic course
Do not miss antibiotics and consume them as directed by your doctor. An incomplete antibiotic course could lead to reinfection. A professional caregiver who can look after the patient at all times can be appointed.
2. Prevent infection from recurring at home
Keep the surroundings clean. Personal hygiene should be maintained at all costs, and wounds should be cleaned and covered at all times. The site of the surgery should be cleaned and dressed regularly.Sepsis might lead to permanent side effects, which might cause loss of mobility or cognitive function. Some people might even lose arms, hands, or legs because of limb amputation. Therefore, appoint a caregiver if needed to help the sepsis patients get around and carry on with daily activities.
3. Stay hydrated
Sepsis patients should consume plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
4. Stop smoking
Sepsis patients should not smoke or consume other tobacco products in the recovery period at home as it can lead to reinfection and delayed recovery.
5. Eat a well-balanced diet
A healthy diet is very important for sepsis patients recovering at home. They should be given a nutritious diet as advised by the doctor. Foods such as nuts, soy, tofu, fatty fish, etc can be consumed for quick recovery. The doctor might advise restrictions on certain food items, which must be avoided at all costs.",

","Symptoms Of Shingles 
Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus responsible for chickenpox. Shingles affect the nerves and manifests through various symptoms.
 
Common symptoms of shingles typically develop in 3 stages and may include:
 
1. Prodrome (Early symptoms stage)


Symptoms may appear 1-4 days before the rash onset. 


Early signs include localized tingling, itching, or burning sensations, often accompanied by intermittent stabbing pain. 


Some individuals may experience systemic symptoms like tiredness, fever, headache, and enlarged lymph nodes in the affected area.


 
2. Infectious rash (Acute stage)


Lasting 7-10 days, the rash typically appears in a band or line on one side of the body, following the path of nerve fibers. 


It may occur on the trunk, neck, forehead, or genitals, accompanied by pain. 


The rash evolves from red lesions to blisters, and crusting over 1-2 weeks. 


Rubbing or scratching the rash can lead to infectious lesions, potentially transmitting the virus.


 
3. Resolution (Healing stage)


Usually, within ten days of rash onset, lesions begin to crumble. This can last 2-4 weeks and may indicate the end of infection.


Healing may take longer in older or immunocompromised patients, with possible scarring or changes in skin color post-resolution.


 
Are shingles contagious?


Shingles patients are contagious once the blisters appear. Those who never had chickenpox or didn’t get the vaccine can get infected with VZV from someone who has shingles. 


VZV can spread by direct contact with the fluid from shingles blisters or by breathing in virus particles from the blisters. If infected, people will get chickenpox, not shingles. However, they could develop shingles later in life.


Individuals suffering from chickenpox are more likely to spread VZV than individuals with shingles.


Covering rashes can lower the risk of spreading the virus. 


Learn more about virus transmission and ways to prevent it.Read Here","Causes Of Shingles
Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, occur when the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which is responsible for chickenpox, is reactivated.  Once an individual has recovered from chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in nerve tissues. This dormant state persists indefinitely, but if the virus reactivates, it manifests as Shingles. However, not everyone who has had chickenpox will experience shingles. While the exact cause of shingles remains uncertain, it is often linked to age-related decline in immunity.  Boost your immune system's defenses against shingles with immune-boosting supplements. Shop Now
 ","Risk Factors For Shingles
Shingles, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, can affect anyone who has previously had chickenpox. Several factors increase the likelihood of developing shingles:
1. Age: Shingles primarily affects older adults, with those over 50 at higher risk due to age-related weakening of immunity.2. Stress: Elevated stress levels can weaken immunity, making the body more susceptible to viral infections like shingles.3. Weakened immunity: Certain conditions, such as cancer and HIV/AIDS, can compromise the immune system, elevating the risk of shingles.4. Immunosuppression: Long-term use of immunosuppressive medications in the following cases can predispose to shingles:

Radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment
Organ transplant
Severe psoriasis or advanced psoriatic arthritis

5. Recent trauma or injury: Physical trauma or injury to the skin can sometimes trigger the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, leading to shingles in the affected area.",,,"Treatment Of Shingles

Headaches and confusion in case the tumour spreads to the brain


Here are some common signs and symptoms that could be suggestive of cancer.Click To Know!","Types Of Testicular Cancer

There are two types of testicular cancer:


Seminoma: This kind of tumour occurs in all age groups. In the case of the elderly who develop testicular cancer, the cell type is more likely to be seminoma. In general, seminomas do not tend to be as aggressive as a nonseminoma. They are usually limited to the testicles and are less likely to spread to other parts of the body.




Nonseminoma: Nonsemina is a tumour that has a tendency to develop in the earlier stages of life. Later it grows in size and spreads rapidly in the body. Nonseminoma tumours tend to involve the lymph nodes. There are different types of non-seminoma tumours including embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumour, choriocarcinoma, and teratoma. 

","Causes Of Testicular Cancer
It's not exactly clear what leads to the development of testicular cancer. Typically, healthy cells in our body undergo division and growth to maintain optimal body function. However, sometimes these cells may develop some abnormalities. Such mutations can cause the previous healthy cells to start diving and growing out of control. These cancerous cells continue dividing despite the body not needing them. Slowly these cancerous cells start getting accumulated and start taking the space and nutrients available for healthy cells. This results in a cancerous mass that can be felt as a lump in the testicle. There are some particular cells in the testicles that produce immature sperm. Some researchers have found that most testicular cancer cells have an extra pair of chromosome number 12. They have also detected the presence of some other chromosomes or an abnormal number of chromosomes in some testicular cancers. Experts are studying these chromosomes and the DNA further to find more about the genes that get affected and lead to the development of testicular cancer. ",,"Prevention Of Testicular Cancer
​​
Unfortunately, currently, researchers have not found a way to prevent testicular cancer. However, early diagnosis can prevent the spread of cancer and present a good prognosis. Men are advised to perform a testicular self-examination (TSE) once a month. 


Performing a TSE can be done while taking a shower or warm bath. A warm bath will help the scrotum to relax, making it easier for you to detect the presence of unusual lumps. 


To do the examination, use both of your hands to examine each testicle. Use your index and middle fingers and place them underneath your testicles while placing your thumb on the top. 


Now gently roll each testicle between your fingers and thumb. Your testicles can feel different in size which is quite normal. As you move your testicles between your fingers lookout for the epididymis. This structure is a tube that stores and transports sperm and feels like a cord on the top and back of your testicle. Do not confuse it with a lump. 


You will be able to feel the presence of lumps since they can be the size of peas or bigger in size. They are often painless in nature. 


In case you feel a lump or observe a change in the size of your testicle, contact your doctor for a medical opinion.

","Specialist To Visit

Testicular cancer can be treated based on the type and staging of cancer. It also depends on several other factors that include your overall health and personal preferences. There are several ways through which testicular cancer can be managed and treated. The staging of testicular cancer is based upon understanding the pattern of spread. One staging classification that is used is the TNM system:


Stage I: Tumour (T) is limited to the testis


Stage II: Tumour has spread to the lymph nodes (N) in the back of the abdomen (retroperitoneum)


Stage III: Metastasis (M) of the cancer has happened, i.e. it has spread to other parts of the body such as lungs, liver, brains, and bone.


For testicular cancer, an S is also added to the TNM system. Serum tumour marker (S) indicates any elevation of serum tumour markers like AFP, beta-hCG, and LDH.

1. Surgery 

Radical inguinal orchiectomy: It is the foremost treatment option for testicular cancer at nearly all stages and types. This procedure is done by a surgeon who will make an incision in the groin region and remove the involved testicle through the opening. According to your choice, a prosthetic and saline-filled testicle can be inserted into the scrotum to make up for the removed testicle. In the early stages of testicular cancer, this surgery can be enough and often the only treatment needed for testicular cancer. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection: It is another surgery that is done by making an incision in your abdomen. In this surgery, your surgeon will do their best to avoid injuring nerves that surround lymph nodes. However, in some cases, it may be unavoidable and hence comes with some level of risk. Damage to the nerves can lead to difficulty with ejaculation; however that won't prevent you from having an erection. Sometimes surgery can be the only treatment option for testicular cancer. In such cases, your doctor will recommend a schedule of follow up appointments. These appointments are usually carried out every month for the initial few years. The frequency of the appointments decreases later and you will be required to undergo blood tests and CT scans. Your doctor may recommend other procedures that will allow them to check for signs that can indicate the return of cancer. 
2. Radiation therapy 
Radiation therapy is a treatment modality that uses high powered energy beams that work as an effective treatment to kill cancer cells. During a radiation therapy appointment, the patient is asked to lie flat on a table. A large machine that emits the energy beam moves around the body and aims the beam at precise points. Radiation therapy is often recommended for patients who have the seminoma type of testicular cancer and can also be recommended after surgery done to remove a testicle. Radiation therapy can lead to some side effects including nausea and fatigue. It can also cause some level of skin erythema and irritation near the abdominal and groin areas. In some cases, radiation therapy can lead to a temporary decline in the levels of sperm count and can also affect fertility. Before the radiation therapy, you can talk to your doctor about the side effects and methods of managing the same. Several men opt to preserve their sperm before beginning radiation therapy. 

3. Chemotherapy 

Chemotherapy treatment is a treatment modality that uses strong medicines that are effective in killing cancer cells. These drugs circulate around the body and aim at destroying cancer cells that may have travelled from the original tumour. According to the stage of testicular cancer, chemotherapy may be your only treatment option or a patient can be advised chemotherapy prior to or post a lymph node surgery. Commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in treatment of testicular cancer are:


Bleomycin


Cisplatin


Etoposide


Ifosfamide


Serum tumour markers are monitored throughout the treatment and usually normalise during or after treatment. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with side effects like myelosuppression (bone marrow is not able to make enough blood cells), nausea, vomiting and hair loss. Bleomycin may be associated with pulmonary fibrosis (lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred). Your doctor can recommend various medications or other treatment options that can help in managing the side effects of chemotherapy.Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of the treatment and about the various options that can allow you to preserve your sperm prior to beginning chemotherapy.  
4. Bone marrow transplantation
Bone marrow transplantation, also known as stem cell transplantation, is the latest state of the art treatment modality. In this procedure, the bone marrow is taken from the patient and treated with drugs to do away with the cancer cells. The marrow is then frozen. The patient is given high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy to destroy the remaining marrow. The marrow earlier removed from the patient is thawed or warmed and injected into a vein of the patient to replace the marrow that was destroyed.",,"Home-care For Testicular Cancer
 
It generally takes about two weeks or two months to recover from an orchiectomy that allows doctors to remove the affected testicle. It is important to follow the post-op instructions given by your doctor during your recovery time. 


You will be advised to avoid lifting anything over ten pounds for the first few weeks of the surgery.


 You will also be asked to refrain from engaging in any kind of sexual activity until you have recovered. 


Activities such as exercising, running or playing sports should be avoided for nearly four weeks post-surgery. 




You will be asked to maintain a schedule of follow up appointments to minimise the risk of testicular cancer returning. There is a small risk that cancer may return or grow in the other testicle. Hence, it is vital that patients maintain follow-up appointments and learn how to perform self testicular examinations. The duration of your follow up care may alter based on your diagnosis and diseases prognosis your follow up care. 

","Complications Of Testicular Cancer

Untreated testicular cancer can lead to certain complications such as:

1. Excessive female hormone 
In some cases, testicular cancer can lead to the increased production of another hormone known as human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG. This hormone is also known as the “pregnancy hormone”. In some cases, the excessive production of hCG can lead to the abnormal enlargement of breast tissue in men. This condition is known as gynecomastia. Some other types of testicular cancer can lead to the development of gynecomastia due to an increase in the levels of another female hormone known as estrogen. 
2. Metastasis or spread of cancer
There can be several complications in case testicular cancer is undiagnosed or left untreated for a long duration of time. This can result in the spread of cancer from the original tumour to other parts of the body.The site to which the original tumour spreads is known as a secondary or metastatic tumour. In the case of metastasis, a patient can present with several symptoms based on the location of the metastatic tumour. These symptoms will include lower back pain, swollen lymph nodes, or swelling and pain in the lower extremities.Retroperitoneum is the most commonly involved site in metastatic disease. Most blood borne metastasis occurs after the lymph node involvement. Lungs are the most common organ involved by blood borne metastasis. If the secondary tumour is present in the lungs, it can result in shortness of breath, coughing up of blood or the presence of chronic cough. Symptoms such as headaches or confusion can be seen if a secondary tumour spreads to the brain. 

3. Late effects of chemotherapy

Patients treated with cisplatin based chemotherapy have increased risk of development of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular events. Patients treated with high cumulative dose of etoposide may experience some risk of developing other cancers like acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), typically 2-3 years after therapy."

","Symptoms Of Tetanus

The most common sign of this infection is tightening of the jaw muscles. Tetanus infection can lead to serious health problems, including being unable to open the mouth and having trouble swallowing and breathing. Other symptoms include:


Jaw cramping
Sudden, involuntary muscle spasms often in the stomach
Painful muscle stiffness all over the body
Trouble swallowing
Seizures (jerking or staring)
Headache
Fever and sweating
Changes in blood pressure and heart rate
",,"Causes Of Tetanus

Tetanus is caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium tetani bacteria spores found in dust, animal feces, and soil. When these spores enter a deep flesh wound, they transform into bacteria that release a lethal toxin known as tetanospasmin.

The toxin damages the muscles, specifically the motor neurons that control muscle function. This causes muscle spasms and stiffness, which is a major symptom of tetanus.

Tetanus cases are frequently seen in people who have never been immunized or in adults who have not received their 10-year booster shot. Tetanus is not a contagious disease and thus cannot be passed from person to person.

Other ways:
Tetanus bacteria can also infect someone’s body through breaks in the skin caused by:


Clean superficial wounds (when only the topmost layer of skin is scraped off)
Surgical procedures
Insect bites
Dental infections
Compound fractures (an exposed broken bone)
Chronic sores and infections
Intravenous (IV) drug use
Intramuscular injections (shots given in a muscle)
",,,"Prevention Of Tetanus

Vaccination and good wound care are the cornerstones in the prevention of a tetanus infection. They are discussed as follows:

I. Vaccination
The only way to prevent a tetanus infection is by getting vaccinated on time. The tetanus vaccine shot is usually given in the deltoid muscle. The tetanus vaccine is given as part of the following vaccines:



Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine: Contains full doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines. 


Diphtheria and tetanus (DT) vaccine


Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine: Contains a full dose of the tetanus vaccine and a lower dose of diphtheria and whooping cough vaccines.


Tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine


Tetanus Toxoid (TT) vaccine



Note: DTaP/DT are only given to babies and children younger than 7 years whereas Tdap/Td/TT are given to adolescents and adults.

Who should take tetanus vaccination and when?

Children

Children between 2 months to 6 years should get 5 DTaP shots. Three doses at 6, 10 & 14 weeks and two booster doses at 16-24 months and 5-6 years of age respectively.
Children who had a very bad reaction to DTaP can receive DT vaccine. However, they will not receive any protection against whooping cough.
Children 11-12 years should get 1 booster shot of Tdap.


Adults 

Adults over 18 years who did not receive primary immunization, three doses of Td vaccine are indicated. Two doses are administered at least 4 weeks apart, and the third dose is given 6-12 months after the second dose. The Tdap vaccine can substitute any one of the Td doses.
Adults who have completed their primary vaccination schedule, should get TT or Td shot every 10 years till the age of 65. One dose of Tdap vaccine may be administered in place of Tt/Td vaccine. 


Pregnant women

The national immunization schedule in India recommends the 2 doses of TT/Td regardless of the immunization status of pregnant women. There should be a minimum gap of 4 weeks between the two doses. Tdap vaccination can also be considered instead of the second dose of TT/Td injection.
If a mother received 2 TT/Td doses in the last pregnancy and gets pregnant within 3 years then only one booster dose is recommended.


Contraindications of Tetanus vaccination

History of a severe adverse reaction to any vaccination ingredient.
If within seven days following vaccination and without apparent explanation, suffered encephalopathy (such as coma, diminished level of consciousness, or persistent seizures).
History of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)


Immunization is one of the most effective tools to prevent severe infections in kids as well as adults. Know more about 7 vaccinations to protect against deadly diseases.

II. Appropriate wound care
You need to take proper care if you get any cut, wound or injury especially if it is contaminated. 
Here are a few tips that you need to follow if you have a minor wound or injury:



Control bleeding: Use a clean tissue, piece of gauze, or clean cloth to apply direct pressure to the cut or wound until bleeding stops. To aid in reducing bleeding, try to elevate the arm or leg above the heart if possible. 


Maintain hygiene: First of all, wash your hands before cleaning and dressing the wound. Once the bleeding has stopped, a saline solution, bottled water, or clear running water should be used to rinse the wound.


Cover the wound: Use a sterile bandage after using an antibiotic cream to lower the chance of infection. To keep the wound clean and dry, change the bandage frequently as it will keep harmful bacteria out.


Change the dressing: Replace the bandage at least once every day, or whenever the dressing is soiled or wet, and change the dressing. You can use an antibiotic ointment.


Manage adverse reactions: If you observe any rash or wound getting worse due to antibiotic use or if you are allergic to the adhesive used in bandages switch to adhesive-free dressings or sterile gauze and paper tape.

","Specialists To Visit
The following specialists help to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with tetanus:


General physician
Toxicologist
Neurologist
Pulmonary medicine specialist
Anesthesiologist


A toxicologist helps to rule out any poisoning and to determine if any substance is toxic or harmful. A neurologist is a doctor who treats diseases of nerves and in the case of tetanus, they treat seizures. A pulmonary medicine specialist can help when there is respiratory compromise and can help with providing ventilation.An anesthesiologist is to administer drugs, such as baclofen.

When to see a doctor?

You are not sure about completing your tetanus vaccination schedule.
You haven't received a tetanus injection in the last ten years.
Not sure when the last tetanus vaccination was taken.
You are injured outdoors.
The wound has been in direct contact with soil.
The wound has dirt or debris that won’t come out.
A deep puncture wound, an object in the wound, an animal bite, or a severe cut.

Tetanus is a medical emergency and its management comprises the following:
1. Early and aggressive wound debridement
It is advisable to surgically debride any wounds that are present. It's essential to clean your wound with sterile or clean water and an antiseptic solution to get rid of any dirt, debris, or foreign objects that could harbor bacteria. 

Always keep your first aid kit handy in case of an emergency.

2. Antimicrobial therapy
Although they are always advised, antibiotics probably only have a little part to play in the treatment of tetanus. It is crucial to note that without proper wound debridement, appropriate antibiotic therapy may fall short of eliminating C. tetani. Drugs used are:


Metronidazole 
Penicillin G
Cefuroxime


3. Human tetanus immune globulin (HTIG)
Neutralization of unbound toxins with Human tetanus immune globulin is given. All patients with suspected tetanus should immediately receive both passive (with TIG) and active (tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines). 

4. Drugs to control muscle spasms
Generalized muscle spasms are life-threatening since they can cause respiratory failure, lead to aspiration, and induce generalized exhaustion in the patient. 

Note: Long-term muscle contractions result in abrupt, strong, and painful muscle group contractions. It's known as tetany. This is called tetany. These are the episodes that can cause fractures and muscle tears.

There are several drugs that may be used to control these spasms which include:


Benzodiazepines (like diazepam)
Pancuronium
Antispasmodics (like baclofen)
Magnesium sulfate


5. Hospitalization and supportive care

People with severe tetanus need to stay in an intensive care environment. As sedatives inhibit breathing you might need to stay under ventilation temporarily. 
Nutritional support should also be initiated early. As the energy demands in tetanus can be extremely high due to repeated spasms, excessive sweating, muscular contractions etc.
Heparin or any other anticoagulant should be administered early in order to prevent blood clotting in veins.
Tetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles, which eventually can affect your chest, neck, back, and abdominal muscles. Hence, physical therapy is suggested as soon as spasms have stopped.


6. Vaccination during recovery
Tetanus disease does not provide immunity against tetanus. Active immunization should be initiated or continued with a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine as soon as the person’s condition has stabilized.

Serious health problems that can happen because of tetanus include:
1. Laryngospasm: It is uncontrolled/involuntary tightening of the vocal cords that may lead to interference with breathing. 2. Fractures: Fractures of the spine or long bones may result from involuntary muscle movements. 3. Hypertension and/or abnormal heart rhythm: Hyperactivity seen in tetanus may lead to hypertension. It can also cause abnormal heart rhythm. 4. Nosocomial infections: These are infections that are acquired while getting medical care but were absent at the time of admission. They are also known as healthcare-associated infections (HAI).5. Pulmonary embolism: It refers to a blood clot that has passed through the bloodstream from another part of the body and blocked the major artery of the lung or one of its branches. 6. Aspiration pneumonia: It is a lung infection that develops when things like saliva or vomit accidentally go into the lungs. 7. Death: Tetanus can be fatal in some cases.These mostly include people 60 years of age or older and those who have never received a vaccination.",
Thalassemia,https://www.1mg.com/diseases/thalassemia-821,"Types Of Thalassemia
 
Alpha-thalassemia
In alpha-thalassemia, the severity of the condition depends on the number of mutated genes you receive from your parents. In case you inherit:


One mutated gene - You are a carrier of thalassemia and may not show any symptoms. 


Two mutated genes - You will show mild signs of thalassemia.


Three mutated genes - You will show moderate to severe signs of thalassemia. 


Beta-thalassemia 
Two genes are required for producing the beta-globin chain. In case you inherit:


One mutated gene - You may show mild symptoms of thalassemia. This condition is known as thalassemia minor. However, there is a 50% chance that you may not show symptoms if only one gene is damaged. In this case, you will be a thalassemia carrier.


Two mutated genes - Your symptoms may be moderate to severe. This condition is referred to as thalassemia major. Babies born with thalassemia major are generally healthy at birth but may show signs and symptoms within 2 years.

","Symptoms Of Thalassemia
Symptoms of thalassemia generally occur during childhood or late adolescence. For people with thalassemia minor, the symptoms may not be visible. However, people suffering from thalassemia major may experience a wide range of symptoms. The severity of the symptoms may also vary and depend on the type of thalassemia.Some of the common signs and symptoms of thalassemia include:

1. Weakness or fatigue

It is caused as the hemoglobin cannot carry enough oxygen to various parts of the body. The muscles do not receive enough oxygen and reduce the amount of energy produced by the body.

2. Pale or yellowish skin

Some people with thalassemia may have extremely pale or yellowish skin as this condition reduces red blood cells in the body.

3. Weak and brittle bones

Another common symptom of thalassemia is weak bones. An increase in the amount of iron in the body may reduce or interfere with the absorption of calcium and Vitamin D. This may lead to weak and brittle bones over time.

4. Dark urine

In people with thalassemia, there may be an increase in the breakdown of red blood cells in the body. This may lead to an excess release of bilirubin from the cells, which may cause your urine to become darker.

5. Deformities in the face or skull

In some cases, thalassemia may lead to an expansion in the bones, which in turn may cause the bones in your face to widen.

6. Growth failure

Anemia can cause the growth of a child to slow down. Puberty may also be delayed in children with thalassemia.

7. Iron overload

People with thalassemia can get an overload of iron in their bodies, either from the disease itself or from frequent blood transfusions. Too much iron can result in damage to the heart, liver, and endocrine system, which includes glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout the body. The damage is characterized by excessive deposits of iron. Without adequate iron chelation therapy, almost all patients with beta-thalassemia accumulate potentially fatal iron levels.

8. Infection

People with thalassemia have an increased risk of infection. This is especially true if the spleen has been removed.

9. Enlarged spleen
The spleen aids in fighting infection and filters unwanted material such as old or damaged blood cells. Thalassemia is often accompanied by the destruction of a large number of red blood cells and the task of removing these cells causes the spleen to enlarge. Splenomegaly can make anemia worse, and it can reduce the life of transfused red blood cells. Severe enlargement of the spleen may necessitate its removal.","Causes Of Thalassemia
Every person has three types of blood cells in their body - red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. The red blood cells consist of an iron-rich protein known as hemoglobin, which is responsible for providing oxygen from lungs to other parts of the body. Thalassemia occurs when there is a mutation in the gene that controls the formation of red blood cells. The hemoglobin in our body has two kinds of protein chains - alpha-globin and beta-globin. If mutations in the gene cause either of the alpha protein chain or the beta protein chain to be abnormal, it may stop the production of red blood cells in the body. There won't be enough cells to carry oxygen to various organs, and your body may not function properly. The reduction in the number of alpha chains leads to alpha-thalassemia and the reduction in the number of beta chains causes beta-thalassemia. Children generally inherit these mutations from their parents.Both α- and β-thalassemias are often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Cases of dominantly inherited α- and β-thalassemias have been reported, the first of which was in an Irish family with two deletions of 4 and 11 bp in exon 3 interrupted by an insertion of 5 bp in the β-globin gene. For the autosomal recessive forms of the disease, both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected.","Diagnosis Of Thalassemia
 
If you experience any thalassemia symptoms such as fatigue, then it is wise to consult a doctor. It may also be advised to consult a doctor if you're pregnant and either you or your partner have thalassemia or are carriers.Your doctor might do some physical examination followed by a few thalassemia tests to evaluate the severity of your child's condition. The tests include:

Complete blood count (CBC)

In this test, the doctor evaluates the number of red blood cells in your body. They will also be able to detect the amount of hemoglobin in the cells and determine their shape and size.
The Mentzer index
The index is calculated from the results of a complete blood count. If the quotient of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV, in fL) divided by the red blood cell count (RBC, in millions per microLiter) is less than 13, thalassemia is said to be more likely. If the result is greater than 13, then iron-deficiency anemia is said to be more likely.

Blood smear

In this test, a trained professional examines a sample of your blood under the microscope. This test helps detect any abnormal cells in the blood.

Iron studies

These tests measure the body's iron storage capacity and usage. It may include tests for determining unsaturated iron-binding capacity, iron-binding capacity, and percent saturation of transferrin.

Prenatal testing

This testing is carried out during pregnancy to determine whether a baby has thalassemia or not before birth. Tests used to diagnose thalassemia before birth are:


Chorionic villus sampling: In this test, a tiny sample of the placenta is evaluated to find out whether the baby suffers from the condition or not. 


Amniocentesis: Generally done during the 16th week, this test examines the fluid surrounding the fetus.


Hemoglobin electrophoresis
This test helps identify different types of hemoglobin present in the blood. It helps detect the abnormal type of hemoglobin and diagnose different types of anemia.To get the right diagnosis, it is important to consult the right doctor.

As thalassemia is an inherited condition, it may be challenging to prevent it. However, there are not many ways to manage the condition and reduce its implications on your health excepy for genetic screening.One of the sure-shot ways to prevent the passing of thalassemia from parents to offspring is through genetic screening. If either or both of the partners are a carrier of the gene that causes thalassemia, genetic screening may help determine whether the baby is affected by it or not. There are several types of prenatal tests available that can be taken in the early or later stages of pregnancy to check whether your baby is safe or has thalassemia, major or minor.Large scale awareness campaigns are being organized in India by both the Government and non-government organizations in favor of voluntary premarital screening to detect carriers of thalassemia and marriage between both carriers is strongly discouraged.","Specialist To Visit
The intensity of the symptoms of thalassemia may vary depending on the type of thalassemia. Most doctors can predict whether a baby has thalassemia if either parent has thalassemia majors or are carriers. For people who are carriers or have thalassemia minor, medical treatment may not be required. However, children or adults with thalassemia major may need to visit their doctor regularly to manage the disease. Even a gynecologist and genetic counselor can help you diagnose or prevent the transmission of thalassemia to your child by conducting prenatal testing.Specialists that can help manage thalassemia include:

People who have thalassemia minor and show mild symptoms may not require any treatment. However, for people with moderate to severe thalassemia, the following treatments may be required:

1. Vitamin supplements

Vitamin supplements may be required in addition to the regular treatments available to manage thalassemia successfully. For thalassemia minor patients, only vitamin supplements may be recommended to manage the condition.Folic acid is the most common vitamin recommended to people with thalassemia. It helps build healthy red blood cells and is prescribed to people alongside transfusions and iron chelation therapy. Apart from this, your doctor may also prescribe Vitamin D and calcium supplements to avoid osteoporosis and build stronger bones.

2. Iron chelation therapy

The hemoglobin present in the red blood cells consists of a high amount of iron. Thus, frequent blood transfusions may result in a build-up of excess iron in the body. This may lead to an iron overload and cause damage to the heart, liver, and other organs of the body.Even for people who don't have frequent transfusions, an iron overload may still occur. Your doctor may recommend iron chelation therapy to maintain your health and eliminate the excess iron from your body. Doctors use three common medicines for iron chelation therapy which include:


Deferoxamine: It is an injectable that is administered overnight to the patient. This therapy may take time and lead to various side effects.




Deferasirox: It is a pill that needs to be taken once daily. It may cause side effects such as nausea and vomiting; however, they are generally short-lived.


Deferiprone: This is a medication that is given by mouth. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are relatively common with its use. It is available in both Europe and the United States. It appears to be the most effective agent when the heart is significantly involved.


3. Blood transfusions
Blood transfusion is considered the best treatment for people with thalassemia major. In this treatment, healthy red blood cells with high hemoglobin are transferred into your body using an intravenous (IV) line. This procedure usually takes around 1 to 4 hours.Red blood cells (RBCs) usually live only up to 120 days. Hence, you may require frequent blood transfusions to manage your condition.However, if you have beta-thalassemia intermedia, transfusions may be required occasionally. For example, when you have severe anemia or have contracted an infection. 

4. Bone marrow transplant

Bone marrow transplant, also known as stem cell transplant, may be considered for your treatment if you have a severe case of thalassemia. Bone marrow is a spongy tissue present inside your bone. The stem cells in the bone marrow are responsible for producing red and other types of blood cells.A bone marrow transplant is the only effective way to treat thalassemia. For children, it may also eliminate the need for frequent blood transfusions. This procedure requires receiving stem cells from a compatible donor, which are then infused inside your body. Success rates have been in the 80–90% range. Mortality from the procedure is about 3%.Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is one relevant side effect of bone marrow transplantation. Further research is necessary to evaluate whether mesenchymal stromal cells can be used as prophylaxis or treatment for GvHD.

5. Hemoglobin (Hb) inducer drugs

Thalassemia patients who do not respond well to blood transfusions can take hydroxyurea or thalidomide, and sometimes a combination of both. Hydroxyurea is the only FDA approved drug for thalassemia. Patients who took 10 mg/kg of hydroxyurea every day for a year had significantly higher hemoglobin levels, and it was a well-tolerated treatment for patients who did not respond well to blood transfusions. Another hemoglobin-inducer includes thalidomide, although it has not been tested in a clinical setting. The combination of thalidomide and hydroxyurea resulted in hemoglobin levels increasing significantly in transfusion-dependent and non-transfusion dependent patients

6. Gene therapy

Gene therapy is being studied for thalassemia.The procedure involves collecting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the affected person's blood. The HSCs then have a beta-globin gene added using a lentiviral vector. After destroying the affected person's bone marrow with a dose of chemotherapy (a myeloablative conditioning regimen), the altered HSCs are infused back into the affected person where they become engrafted in the bone marrow where they proliferate. This potentially results in a progressive increase in hemoglobin A2 synthesis in all subsequent developing red blood cells, with resultant resolution of the anemia.While one person with beta thalassemia has no longer required blood transfusions following treatment within a research trial, it is not an approved treatment as of 2018.",,"Home-care For Thalassemia
Diet plays a key role in the management of thalassemia. Here are some dos and don'ts you need to follow to help your body manage thalassemia:
Do’s 


Eat foods rich in calcium such as milk and other dairy products.


Consume a well-balanced diet that is low in sugar and carbohydrates.


Ask your doctor about the additional vitamin supplements that you may need to consume.


Don’ts 


Avoid intake of iron supplements.


Avoid intake of foods rich in iron such as spinach, broccoli, dates, and fish.


Avoid engaging in strenuous exercises.


Avoid smoking or consuming alcohol.


Do not take any supplements or medicines without consulting your doctor.


Wash your hands regularly and avoid going near sick people if you've had your spleen removed.

","Complications Of Thalassemia
Having thalassemia minor may not lead to any complications. However, if you have moderate to severe thalassemia, certain complications may arise.Iron overload: Thalassemia may lead to an increase in the amount of iron in the body. A greater amount of iron may cause damage to the heart, liver, or other organs of the body.Enlarged spleen: As the name suggests, thalassemia may often lead to inflammation and enlargement of the spleen. The spleen is responsible for filtering unwanted red blood cells, and hence, an enlarged spleen may make your anemia worse.Heart problems: Thalassemia can lead to severe heart issues like abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure, if left untreated or unattended.Infections: People with thalassemia who have had their spleen removed are at a greater risk of developing numerous diseases. Delayed growth: Thalassemia may slow down or delay the growth of a child.Bone deformities: Thalassemia may expand the bone marrow and widen the bones in the face or skull. The expansion may also make the bones more brittle and increase your risk of breaking them."

 ","Types of Throat Cancer
 
Throat cancer can be categorized based on the part of the throat affected, i.e pharynx (that includes the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx) or the larynx:
 
1. Nasopharyngeal: This type of cancer occurs in the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose. 
 
2. Oropharyngeal cancer: This cancer affects the oropharynx, which includes the base of the tongue, tonsils, soft palate, and the walls of the pharynx. 
 
3. Hypopharyngeal cancer: This rare type of cancer originates in the hypopharynx, which is the lower part of the throat that surrounds the larynx and esophagus (the muscular tube that connects the throat to the stomach).
 
4. Laryngeal cancer: Laryngeal cancer develops in the larynx, commonly known as the voice box. ","Causes Of Throat Cancer
 
The cause of throat cancer is generally attributed to genetic mutations in the cells of the throat, which lead to uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of tumors. 
 
Here's an overview of the processes involved in cancer:
 
1. DNA, the hereditary material, controls the behavior, growth, division, and death of cells.
2. Certain genes regulate the timing of cell growth, division, and death, such as:
 


Oncogenes promote cell growth, division, and survival.


Tumor suppressor genes, control cell division and initiate cell death when necessary.


 
Throat cancer can result from DNA mutations that activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and abnormal mass formation in the throat.
 
Note: Cancer has a dual connection with our genes. Firstly, there are inherited gene mutations that are transmitted through families. Secondly, there are acquired gene mutations that develop over an individual's lifetime. 
 
Explore genetic testing for comprehensive cancer risk assessment and personalized treatment strategies. 
Read More","Diagnosis Of Throat Cancer
 
The diagnosis of throat cancer involves a comprehensive approach, including:
1. Medical history and physical examination


The doctor will begin by taking a detailed medical history, including information about symptoms, risk factors, and any relevant family history.


A thorough physical examination of the throat, neck, and surrounding areas will be conducted to identify any abnormalities, such as lumps or changes in tissue.


 
2. Imaging studies
Imaging tests help determine the extent of the cancer and whether it has spread to other areas. Common imaging studies include:
 


CT scan (Computed tomography): Provides detailed cross-sectional images of the throat and surrounding structures.


 


MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging): Produces detailed images that can help evaluate the extent of tumor involvement.


PET-CT scan (Positron Emission Tomography with Computed Tomography): Helps identify areas with increased metabolic activity, indicating possible cancer spread.


Barium swallow: It involves swallowing a contrast material containing barium to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract during X-rays. It can reveal abnormalities in various throat regions, often identifying small, early-stage tumors.


 


X-ray: Conducting an X-ray of the chest helps assess potential lung metastasis. Lung involvement typically indicates advanced cancer.


Bone scan: It involves injecting a low-dose radioactive tracer into the veins to detect cancer-related bone injuries. This imaging technique is recommended when there are indications that the cancer may have spread to the bones.


 
3. Biopsy
Tissue samples obtained during endoscopy or other procedures are sent to a pathologist for examination. There are three main types:
 

Endoscopic biopsy: A lighted instrument called an endoscope is used to visualize and sample abnormal areas in the throat.
Incisional biopsy: Small tissue pieces are cut from abnormal areas, often requiring surgery in an operating room with general anesthesia.
Fine needle aspiration (FNA cytology): A thin needle is used to extract cells from tumors or lumps.

 
4. Endoscopy
This involves the use of a flexible tube with a light and camera (endoscope) to examine the inside of the throat. Types include:
 


Panendoscopy, or upper endoscopy: Involves a thorough examination of the upper digestive system, including the larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine for cancer using endoscopes.


Laryngoscopy:  It is done to visually examine the larynx (voice box) using a flexible or rigid scope, allowing for the detection and evaluation of abnormalities,  and tumors.


Pharyngoscopy: This is done to check the abnormalities of the throat using a flexible or rigid scope.


Videostroboscopy: It is a fiber optic video technique similar to indirect laryngoscopy, aids in identifying tumor location, size, and impact on laryngeal function, enabling early detection of potential changes before they become visible.


 
5. Additional tests
 


Blood Tests: Certain Blood tests such as complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), international normalized ratio (INR) etc. can detect certain infections, or monitor the effects of treatment. It can provide valuable information about a patient's overall health and may contribute to the overall assessment of their condition.


 


Genetic testing (Genome testing): This test assesses tumor cells for genetic mutations associated with the specific cancer type. It provides insights for personalized treatment strategies.


 


HPV testing for throat cancer: Particularly relevant in HPV-positive cases, this test facilitates the development of customized treatment plans with reduced intensity and minimized side effects.

Throat cancer, like any form of cancer, can lead to various complications, depending on factors such as the stage of cancer, its location, and the chosen treatment. Some common complications associated with throat cancer include:



Voice changes: This can range from hoarseness to a complete loss of voice depending on the location of the cancer, particularly if the larynx (voice box) is affected.


 


Difficulty swallowing or speaking: Throat cancer, depending on its stage and location, can impair the normal function of the throat and vocal cords.


 


Malnutrition: Difficulty swallowing and changes in taste can contribute to malnutrition.


 


Infections: Weakened immune defenses from cancer treatments can make patients more susceptible to infections, including respiratory and oral infections.


 


Airway obstruction: It may occur due to the tumor's growth, leading to breathing difficulties and potentially necessitating interventions like a tracheostomy to maintain an open airway.


 


Oral mucositis: It is inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the oral cavity. It is a common side effect of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.


 


Tissue fibrosis: It is the scarring of healthy tissues in the throat that can result from radiation therapy leading to reduced flexibility, impaired function, and complicating swallowing and speaking.


 


Reduced salivation: This is reduced saliva production, often due to radiation therapy, which can lead to dry mouth increasing the risk of dental issues.


 


Disfigurement: Surgical procedures, radiation, and the progression of the disease itself can result in changes to facial appearance, causing emotional distress and impacting a patient's self-esteem.

","Symptoms Of Thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia can cause several symptoms that can affect your day to day life. It is possible to experience more than one symptom at a time. 


Getting bruised easily 


Prolonged/excessive bleeding from wounds


Superficial bleeding that appears as pinpoint red spots called petechiae 


Bleeding from gums or nose 


Enlarged spleen 


Extreme fatigue


Blood in urine or stool 


Heavy menstrual flow 


Bleeding inside the gastrointestinal (stomach) tract


Bleeding from the anus 


Unusual bleeding after dental work or surgery


Red, brown or purple bruises are called purpura 


You need to talk to your doctor immediately, if you observe signs of internal bleeding such as blood in your vomit, stool or urine. This condition can rarely lead to bleeding in the brain when a patient's platelet count becomes excessively low. This can cause symptoms like headaches and other neurological signs. Low platelet count can also occur due to reasons such as pregnancy. Such cases usually don't result in any symptoms and may go undetected. Severe cases can result in excessive and uncontrollable bleeding from wounds. These patients require immediate medical attention as continued bleeding might result in hemorrhagic shock or hypovolemic shock which may prove fatal, if left untreated.  ","Causes Of Thrombocytopenia
 
The normal range of platelet count is from 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter. Thrombocytopenia means that your body has fewer than the average number of platelets per microliter of circulating blood. Circulating platelets can be reduced for one or more reasons which include the following: 


Increased platelet destruction


Decreased platelet production


Increased sequestration or trapping of platelets


Dilution of blood


 
1. Conditions that cause increased destruction of platelets
The bone marrow is responsible for producing platelets in the body. In some specific conditions, the immune system starts producing antibodies that attack platelets instead of infections. Some causes include:


Autoimmune diseases: In autoimmune diseases, the body's immune system starts to attack healthy cells of the body. One example of this type of autoimmune disease is immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In ITP, the immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. The exact cause of this condition is not known. Other autoimmune diseases such as antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis can also cause thrombocytopenia.


Medications: Certain medications such as heparin (anticoagulant medication that prevents clot formation), quinine and valproic acid can sometimes trigger the immune system and result in the formation of anti-platelet antibodies that attack the body's own platelets. Sulfa containing antibiotics and anticonvulsants are some other medications that can cause thrombocytopenia. 


Infections: Bacterial infections such as Helicobacter pylori infections, leptospirosis, brucellosis and anaplasmosis can result in low platelet count. Chronic viral infections like hepatitis C and HIV anti-platelets antibodies are present which cause platelet destruction.




Surgery: Platelets can get destroyed when they pass through artificial heart valves, blood vessel grafts, or machines and tubes used for blood transfusions or bypass surgery.


Pregnancy: During pregnancy, some women develop a mild to moderate form of thrombocytopenia when they are close to delivering a baby. Thrombocytopenia during the third trimester is usually mild and resolves soon after delivery. Doctors may continue to monitor platelet count through the remaining pregnancy to prevent the number from dropping further. 


Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): It is a rare blood disorder in which blood clots start developing in small blood vessels in the body. These clots reduce the number of circulating platelets and result in thrombocytopenia. 


Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): It is a rare complication of pregnancy, severe infections, or severe trauma. In this condition, the blood clots form suddenly throughout the body that use up many of the blood's platelets.


Hemolysis, elevated liver tests, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome: It is another non-immune thrombocytopenia that may occur during pregnancy.




Hemolytic uremic syndrome: It is a rare disorder caused by shiga toxin-producing organisms (E. coli and Shigella) that leads to a decline in the number of platelets.


2. Conditions that cause decreased platelet production
There are some conditions in which the bone marrow fails to produce enough platelets. The causes include:


Cancers: Leukaemia (blood cancer), lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndromes cause uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in the bone marrow. These abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells that are typically present in the bone marrow, including platelets. Thrombocytopenia is a widespread and early presentation in patients with acute leukaemia. Patients who have cancer can also experience low platelet count as a side effect of chemotherapy.




Bone marrow failure: It is seen in aplastic anemia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria which can cause severe reduction in platelet count. Aplastic anemia is a rare condition in which the body stops producing new blood cells. Such individuals often develop a low platelet count and deficiency of red and white blood cells. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is closely related to aplastic anemia.




Chronic alcoholism: Thrombocytopenia is commonly seen in heavy drinkers since alcohol exposure slows down the production of megakaryocytes, large bone marrow cells that are responsible for producing platelets. 


Viral infections: Infections caused by varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, mumps virus, parvovirus B19, rickettsia, rubella virus, zika virus, hepatitis C virus and HIV can cause reduced platelet production.




Nutritional deficiencies: Lack of Vitamin B12, folate and copper can cause low platelet production.


Toxic chemicals: Exposure to toxic chemicals such as arsenic, benzene, and pesticides can affect the normal production of platelets.


Cirrhosis or scarring of liver: It causes reduced production of thrombopoietin, a hormone which regulates the production of platelets. This leads to reduced production of platelets by the bone marrow.


Congenital conditions: Conditions like Fanconi anemia, gray platelet syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Alport syndrome, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, platelet-type or pseudo–von Willebrand disease, May-Hegglin syndromes, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.


Medications: Over-the-counter medicine such as aspirin or ibuprofen can affect production of platelets. Certain medicines like diuretics, chloramphenicol, methotrexate, interferon, carboplatin, and amiodarone, also cause bone marrow to decrease production of platelets.


3. Conditions that cause increased trapping of platelets
Enlarged spleen can also lead to thrombocytopenia. The spleen is a vital organ that fights off infections and plays a role in filtering any unwanted substances from your blood. Normally, one-third of platelet mass is in the spleen.The spleen can get enlarged due to medical conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver, a late-stage liver disease that causes permanent damage to the liver. It is also seen in Gaucher's disease, an inherited condition that causes fatty substances to build up in tissues and bone marrow conditions, such as myelofibrosis.In such cases, the enlarged spleen traps platelets and prevents their circulation into the bloodstream. This results in sequestration (removal) of platelets up to 90% of the spleen's total mass, resulting in thrombocytopenia.
4. Conditions that cause dilution of blood
Dilution of blood in cases of massive blood transfusion and massive fluid resuscitation can cause thrombocytopenia.",,,"Prevention Of Thrombocytopenia
Prevention of thrombocytopenia depends on the cause behind the condition. Usually, you can't prevent a low platelet count, but if you are at risk of developing a low platelet count due to an underlying condition or medical history, you should take prevention measures like:


You can try avoiding heavy drinking since alcohol reduces the development of platelets. 


Avoid contact with toxic chemicals, including arsenic and benzene.


If you are taking medications that are known to lower platelet count, talk to your doctor about alternative drugs. Medicines like aspirin and ibuprofen tend to thin the blood and may increase your chances of excessive bleeding.


Viral infections are known to reduce platelet count. Practice basic hand hygiene and wash your hands before eating. 


You can also talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated against diseases like chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella. You should have your children vaccinated for these viruses as well. Talk to your child's pediatrician about these vaccines.


You should avoid activities with a high risk of bleeding or bruising like contact sports.

","Specialist To Visit
 
You should visit a doctor, if you are experiencing symptoms such as quickly getting bruises, reddish or purplish spots on your lower legs, blood in your urine or stool, excessive bleeding from nose or mouth, abnormally excessive bleeding during menstruation, headache, and other neurological symptoms. These symptoms might indicate the possibility of a low platelet count. You can consult the following doctors for diagnosis:


General physician


Hematologist


If you are facing any symptoms, don’t ignore them but consult our healthcare professionals.Consult Now!","Treatment Of Thrombocytopenia
 
The treatment plan for low platelet count depends on the cause of thrombocytopenia and the severity of the disorder. Doctors decide the course of action with the primary goal of preventing any disability or loss of life due to thrombocytopenia. Generally, mild cases of low platelet count go undiagnosed and may not require any specific treatment. In such cases, your doctor may hold off treatment and simply monitor you for some time. Mild low platelet count also tends to improve when the underlying cause behind the condition is treated. If you have a low platelet count because of an infection, the resultant thrombocytopenia will resolve once the disease is treated. In case you have a low platelet count as a result of an adverse reaction to a drug, your doctor will switch to alternative medicines. Generally, drug-induced low platelet count resolves after the responsible medication is stopped. Thrombocytopenia due to an immune system condition can be resolved by taking medicines that suppress the immune system. 
 
A) Medications 
1. Corticosteroids like dexamethasone or prednisone are often prescribed to raise platelet count. Steroids tend to reduce the rate of platelet destruction and can be administered orally or through the veins. 2. IV immunoglobulins (IVIG) are used for treatment of thrombocytopenia in case you cannot tolerate steroids or if your platelet count drops after completion of steroid treatment. 3. Rituximab helps suppress the immune system to prevent the immune system from attacking its own platelets. This is often prescribed to patients who have persistent ITP. 4. Thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists, also known as platelet growth factors, might be recommended, if treatment with steroids, splenectomy, or rituximab fails to increase the platelet count. These medicines might be prescribed for a long-term. Examples include:


Eltrombopag


Romiplostim 


Avatrombopag 


5. Fostamatinib is a newer drug used for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia and those who haven't responded to other treatments
 
B) Blood or platelet transfusion 
Patients who are at a high risk of bleeding or are actively bleeding are treated with blood or platelet transfusions. A needle is inserted to introduce an intravenous line in your body through which you will receive healthy platelets or blood. This procedure is advised for patients with extremely low platelet count since transfused platelets can last only for around three days in circulation. This is a temporary treatment that transiently raises your platelet count. There are two options for platelet transfusion: 
Random donor platelet concentrates (RDPC): RDP is a platelet transfusion method in which platelets are prepared by centrifuging the whole blood collected from four to five donors and pooling the platelets. With the help of this method, the platelet count is elevated to 5000-10000/ul in an adult of approximately 70 kg body weight.Single donor platelet concentrates (SDPC): SDP is a platelet transfusion method in which platelets are prepared from a single donor by an apheresis machine. A unit of platelet concentrate prepared by this method increases the platelet count by 30000-70000/ul in an adult of 70 kg weight. Single unit SDPC has a platelet content similar to that of 6-8 units of pooled platelets or RDPCs.
C) Splenectomy 
Splenectomy is a surgical procedure in which the spleen is removed from the body. This procedure is usually the last line of treatment and is advised when medications fail to treat low platelet count effectively. It is generally recommended for patients who have immune thrombocytopenia. Once the spleen is removed, a low platelet count resolves in more than half of patients who have ITP. ","Home-care For Thrombocytopenia



If you have been prescribed medications to manage low platelet count, make sure you take those medications on time. Label your drugs and set the alarm to make sure you have the medicines every day at the same time. Follow all the instructions given to you by your doctor. 


Some instructions provided by your healthcare provider may include regularly examining your skin for any scrapes, cuts or bruises. 


Use an electric shaver and a soft toothbrush or mouthwash to avoid injuring your face or mouth. 


Ensure that your nails are trimmed to avoid accidental scrapes. 


If you tend to get constipated, ask your provider for some laxatives to help you pass a motion without strain. Straining while passing motion can cause bleeding in the brain due to increased pressure.


If you have just had a splenectomy procedure, follow post-op instructions given by your doctor closely and monitor your health. 


Note: People with low platelet counts are more likely to have bleeding of the nose. In that case, it is advisable to lean ahead and bend forward to prevent clogging of the mouth and throat with blood. Read about the other possible causes and first-aid tips to manage nose bleeds.Read Now!","Complications Of Thrombocytopenia
People with severe thrombocytopenia are at an increased risk of internal bleeding into the intestines or the brain. Internal bleeding can be fatal and needs immediate medical attention. Signs that can indicate internal bleeding include:


Spotting blood in urine


Dark or tarry, red coloured stools 


Severe headache


Other neurological symptoms (in case of bleeding in the brain)


Hemorrhagic shock


Patients who are advised to undergo splenectomy are given different vaccines to help them prevent infection. Spleen in a part of the immune system and removal of the organ leaves a patient more susceptible to catching infections. Formation of blood clots and bleeding are some other complications of splenectomy. ","Alternative Therapies For Thrombocytopenia
 
If you have mild or moderate thrombocytopenia, you can eat certain foods and supplements to raise your platelet count. Severely low platelet count, however, needs medical treatment. Always consult your doctor before taking any supplement to prevent cross interaction of supplements with other medications. 

Vitamin C

Vitamin C helps in the grouping of platelets and increases their functional efficiency. It also helps in the absorption of iron and increases the platelet count. Broccoli, tomatoes, cauliflower, mangoes and pineapple are good sources of Vitamin C. 

Iron 

Iron plays a vital role in the production of healthy blood cells. Iron supplements can increase platelet count in patients with iron deficiency anaemia. Mussels, lentils, beef, and pumpkin seeds are excellent sources of iron. 
Papaya leaf extract 
Papaya leaf extract can noticeably improve the platelet count in animals. You can consume papaya leaf extract in the form of pills. A study reported increased platelet count in patients with dengue fever when they took papaya leaf juice. 

Melatonin 

The body naturally produces melatonin, and it primarily helps in improving sleep quality. It is also available in the form of tablets, liquid or lotions. Melatonin has been found to increase platelet levels in patients with thrombocytopenia. 

Vitamin B12 

It's been reported that a deficiency of Vitamin B12 is linked with low platelets count. Apart from that, vitamin B12 also helps in maintaining the health of blood cells. Food sources such as clams, eggs, and beef liver are rich in Vitamin B12. Along with animal-based products, dairy products are also rich sources of Vitamin B12. However, in some cases, cow milk can interfere with the production of platelets.  "

Ulcerative colitis can affect different parts of your colon and rectum and the intensity of your condition depends on the amount of inflammation and the area affected. The major types include:



Ulcerative proctitis: In this type, bowel inflammation is limited only to the rectum and typically affects less than six inches of the rectum. Ulcerative proctitis is not associated with an increased risk of cancer.





Left-sided colitis: In this form of ulcerative colitis, there is continuous inflammation that begins at the rectum and extends up to the splenic flexure (a bend in the colon near the spleen).  





Proctosigmoiditis: In this form of ulcerative colitis, inflammation is limited to rectum and sigmoid colon (lower end of the colon) only. 





Extensive colitis: This type of ulcerative colitis affects the entire colon with continuous inflammation beginning at the rectum and extending beyond the splenic flexure (bend in your colon to meet the stomach).

","Causes Of Ulcerative Colitis

Ulcerative colitis generally begins in the rectum and may remain localized or extend proximally, sometimes involving the entire colon (the longest part of the large intestine). But, It rarely involves the entire bowel at once. The exact cause of ulcerative colitis still remains unknown, however, there are numerous risk factors that can lead to its development.

Both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are characterized by bowel symptoms which can be seen in 25-40% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Manage the symptoms by adding these 6 superfoods.Know More","Diagnosis Of Ulcerative Colitis

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic illness that is usually detected only at the later stages. Diagnosis consists of the following investigations:

1. Medical history
A thorough history, including travel history to rule out other causes along with detailed drug history and recent antibiotic use should be considered.

2. Laboratory tests

These tests are done to diagnose anemia, thrombocytosis (a condition in which the body produces platelets in excess), low vitamin D and raised inflammatory markers Tests include:


Complete blood count (CBC)
Blood urea
Serum electrolytes
C-reactive protein
Vitamin D profile
Bone profile
Iron serum
Folate test (Vitamin B9)
Vitamin B12 test
Liver function tests


3. Stool cultures
These are done to determine if there are any infections. The stool culture should be negative in case of ulcerative colitis, but bacterial infections such as C difficile can co-exist.

4. Fecal calprotectin
It is a very sensitive marker for inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, and useful for the differentiation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 

5. Imaging tests
 


Colonoscopy or proctosigmoidoscopy: It might reveal loss of typical vascular pattern, granularity, friability, and ulceration that involves the rectum.


Sigmoidoscopy: It helps in examining the level and extent of bowel inflammation.A sigmoidoscopy can also be used to remove a small sample of tissue from your bowel so it can be tested in a laboratory. 


Endoscopy: It helps in examining the inside of your colon and rectum with a lighted tube inserted through your anus.


Abdominal X-ray: Plain abdominal radiographs are useful for acute onset of ulcerative colitis. They are often entirely normal in inflammatory bowel disease.


CT scan or MRI: These are used for small bowel imaging and can help differentiate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.


6. Biopsy
Usually at least two biopsies from each bowel segment for histological assessment is recommended. However, no histological features are diagnostic of ulcerative colitis, but distortion irregularity can suggest ulcerative colitis.

Ulcerative colitis can progress proximally in 10–19% of patients after 5 years, and in up to 28% of patients at 10 years. The primary aim of medical management is to induce and maintain remission. 

Staging of ulcerative colitis based on the severity of disease:

The severity of ulcerative colitis can be graded depending upon rectal bleeding. It includes:



Mild: Less than four rectal bleeding episodes per day


Moderate: More than four rectal bleeding episodes per day


Severe: More than four rectal bleeding episodes per day along with systemic features of an illness combined with hypoalbuminemia (a condition in which there is lack of albumin protein that's responsible for keeping fluid in your blood vessels).

Treatment depends on the stage of ulcerative colitis and it consists of:
A. In mild-moderate ulcerative colitis
 


Mesalamines: These are the first-line therapy for induction of remission in mild-moderate cases of ulcerative colitis. There are different formulations of mesalamine, including oral, suppository, or liquid enema.


Corticosteroids: Second-line therapies for patients who do not respond to mesalamine are corticosteroids. The drugs used are:





Prednisone


Budesonide-multimatrix (MMX)




 
B. In moderate-severe ulcerative colitis
1. Immunomodulators: These are drugs that modulate the immune system by working on the underlying inflammatory processes. They include:

Infliximab
Adalimumab
Golimumab
Vedolizumab
Tofacitinib


C. In acute severe ulcerative colitis

It is defined as the presence of more than 6 bloody stools per day with increased heart rate, fever, and signs of infection. Medications include:

Infliximab
Cyclosporine
Steroids.

D. Maintenance of remission
Most appropriate maintenance treatment for an individual patient is established by several factors, like disease extent and severity, treatment for induction of remission, and failure of previous maintenance treatments. Mesalazine is the basis of treatment for the maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

E. Surgery

Absolute indications for surgery include uncontrolled bleeding, perforation, and colorectal cancer. Surgery is also indicated in acute severe ulcerative colitis and the most commonly performed surgery for ulcerative colitis are:
 


Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA): This surgery removes the entire colon and rectum while preserving the seal in the anus for normal bowel functioning and to avoid fecal incontinence.


Total proctocolectomy: It is a surgery to remove all of the colon and rectum that may be indicated if there are intestinal manifestations.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease with periods of remission and relapse. Here are complications that can occur from ulcerative colitis:



Pelvic abscess: It is pus-filled lesions in the lower stomach due to inflammation.


Enterocutaneous fistulas: These are the abnormal connections between the intestines or stomach and the skin. They occur due to leakage of contents of the stomach or intestines into the skin after bowel surgery.


Bowel obstruction: Studies have shown that early postoperative small-bowel obstruction occurs in up to 15% of patients after surgery for ulcerative colitis.


Pouch prolapse: Research demonstrates that it is a rare but important complication to consider in patients with ulcerative colitis who have undergone a total proctocolectomy.


Poor growth and development: Individuals with ulcerative colitis and undergoing treatment for the same can have poor growth and delayed puberty. 


Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Individuals with ulcerative colitis may develop another digestive condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). In PSC the bile ducts become progressively inflamed and damaged.


Pouchitis: It is an inflammation in the lining of a pouch created during surgery in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.


Incontinence: Individuals with ulcerative colitis are generally affected by fecal incontinence, i.e. inability to control bowel movement.


Osteoporosis: Individuals with ulcerative colitis are at an increased risk of developing osteoporosis, when the bones become weak and are more likely to fracture.


Sexual dysfunction: Certain medications used to treat ulcerative colitis can impact their sex drive and ability to have sex.


Toxic megacolon: It is swelling and inflammation that spread into the deeper layers of your colon. 


Colon or rectal cancer: The risk of cancer in individuals with ulcerative colitis increases by 2% after 10 years of diagnosis.


Leakage from anastomosis: This is a serious complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) leading to postoperative sepsis and pouch failure.

","Symptoms Of Urinary Bladder Cancer
 
Symptoms of bladder cancer may vary from person to person. However, hematuria (the presence of blood in urine) is observed in most individuals. Urine is often slightly rusty to bright red. 
Other signs and symptoms may include:

Frequent urination
Pain or burning sensation while urinating 
The feeling of incomplete emptying of the bladder
Urinating often during the night

If the cancer has spread beyond the bladder, symptoms may also include:

Difficulty in urination
Back pain
Abdominal pain
Bone pain or tenderness
Pelvic pain
Unintended weight loss 
Loss of appetite
Tiredness
Swelling in the feet

Note: The above symptoms can also be due to underlying urinary tract infections, kidney or bladder stones, or other kidney-related issues, as they also have similar symptoms. So, a proper diagnosis is needed to confirm them.","Types Of Urinary Bladder Cancer
Based on the invasiveness, bladder cancer is of two types:
1. Nonmuscle-invasive (Superficial bladder cancer)


It is also called superficial bladder cancer because cancerous cells affect the bladder's lining and have not invaded the bladder wall.


It is mainly looked at as an early-stage 


Constitutes of almost 70-75% of cases of all diagnosed bladder cancer


 
2. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer 


Cancer has spread into the bladder muscle beyond the lining


Potentially affecting surrounding tissues or organs


Considered as an advanced stage


Represents 25 to 30% of all cases of bladder cancer


 
Stages of bladder cancer


Stage 0: Cancer cells are found in tissue lining the inside of the bladder but have not invaded the bladder wall


Stage 1:  Cancer has spread into the connective tissue but has not reached the muscle layers of the bladder.


Stage 2:  Cancer has spread through the connective tissue into the muscle layers of the bladder.


Stage 3: Cancer has spread into the layer of fat surrounding the bladder and may have spread to the reproductive organs (prostate, seminal vesicles, uterus, or vagina) 


Stage 4: Cancer has spread to the abdominal wall or pelvic wall

","Causes Of Urinary Bladder Cancer
 
The bladder is a balloon-shaped organ in the lower part of the abdomen. Its main function is to store urine until it is passed from the body. Bladder cancer occurs when cells in the bladder undergo uncontrolled growth.Changes occurring in the DNA of normal bladder cells can lead to abnormal growth and cancer formation. DNA, the fundamental chemical in our cells, comprises our genes, which regulate cellular functions beyond physical appearance. Our DNA, which we inherit from our parents, holds a significant influence over a wide range of cellular processes. Specific genes govern the growth, division, and survival of cells:


Oncogenes: These genes promote cell growth, division, and longevity.


Tumor suppressor genes: They typically regulate cell division, DNA repair, and programmed cell death.


The onset of cancer can be attributed to DNA alterations, known as gene mutations. These mutations, whether they activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, are the key drivers of cancer formation. It's important to note that multiple gene mutations are typically required for a cell to progress into cancer, underscoring the complexity and seriousness of this process.Anyone can get bladder cancer. Though unclear what causes it, research has identified some risk factors discussed under the ""risk factors"" section. ","Diagnosis Of Urinary Bladder Cancer
 
Diagnosis of bladder cancer involves a series of steps which involve:
1. Medical history and physical examination
The doctor will gather information about personal and familial history to trace the risk factors. The doctor also inquires about clinical symptoms and recommends lab tests accordingly.
Physical examinations may include a pelvic and rectal exam.
2. Urine test
The primary investigations through a urine test include: 


Hematuria test: A blood sample is viewed under a microscope to determine the presence of blood.


Urine cytology involves the analysis of urine for abnormal cells using a microscope.


A urine culture is done to determine pathogens' presence and rule out infections.


3. Imaging tests
Imaging tests that are used to confirm bladder cancer include:


Cystoscopy: In this procedure, the doctor looks inside the bladder and urethra using a cystoscope. This tool also helps remove tiny bladder tumors or tissue samples for biopsy. 


Biopsy/transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT): A small amount of tissue is studied under a microscope in a biopsy. The tissue is collected using cystoscopy. A CT scan or ultrasound helps to locate the tumor. 


Positron emission tomography (PET) or PET-CT scans involve taking pictures of the inside of the body using a scanner. 


A computed tomography (CT) urogram test captures images of the kidneys, bladder, and ureters, along with detailed pictures of nearby bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels. It helps the doctor evaluate the urinary tract's efficiency and identify potential diseases.


Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is an X-ray imaging test of the urinary tract. A sequence of X-ray pictures is used to identify cancer in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.




Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnetic field to produce detailed body images using a dye. The dye helps obtain a clear picture of the organs in which cancer may have spread. It is used to measure the tumor size and track colon cancer's location. 


Bone scan: This involves scanning the bone using radioactive material. It is used to detect if cancer has spread to the lungs.


Ultrasound uses sound waves to produce a detailed image of the internal organs. It is used to find the locations in which a tumor has spread.


Chest X-rays: An X-ray of the chest is used to detect if colon cancer has spread to the lungs.

","Symptoms Of Urinary Incontinence
Urinary incontinence is not a disease, rather it is usually a symptom of underlying health problems. The symptoms of urinary  incontinence include: 


Leaking urine during normal day to day activities such as lifting weights, coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising without any urge to urinate


Leaking urine during sexual activity


Bedwetting (leaking urine during sleeping)


Being unable to hold urine


Being unable to react toilet in time


Frequent urination (more than 8 times a day)


Feeling of wetness


Feeling of incomplete emptying of bladder

","Causes Of Urinary Incontinence

The urinary system consists of detrusor muscles, the internal and external sphincters, and their neurological components. 
In infants, the fullness of the bladder causes contraction of the detrusor muscles that leads to emptying of the bladder. As we grow, our bladder is trained to respond to the sensation of urge at volumes 200-300 ml. At this stage, a voluntary decision can be made for passing the urine depending upon the location and availability. 
The emptying of the bladder upto 7 times in waking hours in a day is considered normal. The normal tolerance capacity of a healthy bladder is approximately 500 ml which the bladder can accommodate without increasing bladder pressure even during physical activities, coughing, lifting weights etc. 
Any disturbance in the whole mechanism can lead to urinary incontinence. The possible causes are:


Detrusor overactivity: This is the most common cause of urinary incontinence in which there are consistent contractions of the detrusor muscles. This leads to relaxation of the sphincters and involuntary leakage of urine. It is commonly seen after spinal injuries, multiple sclerosis or other lesions of the central nervous system.


Impaired bladder contractility: An inadequately contractile bladder can also cause urinary incontinence. This can be due to aging and several pelvic floor diseases. 


Decreased pressure in urethra closure: The sphincteric unit helps in the closure of the bladder which expresses the urethral pressure during the resting state (where the abdominal pressure is at its resting value where no voiding and no pelvic floor contraction occurs). The decreased pressure in urethra closure can also leakage of urine. 


Atrophy of urethral areas: It is a medical condition in which urethra and its surrounding structures lose its strength and elasticity. It also causes urinary incontinence due to dysfunctioning of the urinary system. The atrophy is commonly seen in postmenopausal women due to estrogen deficiency. 


Prostatic hypertrophy: The enlarged prostate in men also puts pressure on the bladder which can cause UI. 


Urethral hypermobility: It is a condition in which there is an excess movement of urethra that can cause UI. It can be due to pregnancy, vaginal delivery, obesity, smoking, chronic cough, and chronic constipation


Weakness of urinary sphincter: Some conditions such as advanced age, menopause, enlarged prostate weaken the sphincter and pelvic floor muscles which can lead to UI. 


Poor detrusor compliance: Sometimes, the bladder fails to stretch, which causes increased pressure, discomfort during filling and reduces urine holding capacity of the bladder. This pattern is typical after pelvic radiotherapy, or can result from prolonged periods of catheterization. 



Reversible causes of Urinary incontinence
Reversible causes of UI, often described by the mnemonic DIAPPERS includes: 

D- Delirium (confusion)
I - Infection (urinary tract infection)
A- Atrophic (urethral atropy due to menopause)
P- Pharmacological (medications)
P- Psychological (disorders such as stress and anxiety)
E- Endocrine (excess urine production)
R- Restricted mobility (not able to reach washroom on due to conditions such as arthritis)
S- Stool impaction (hardened stool that's stuck in the rectum or lower colon due to chronic constipation)","Types Of Urinary Incontinence

Urge incontinence


It is characterized with a feeling of sudden and strong urge to urinate, usually more than 8 times a day.


In this, the patient is not able to hold urine long enough to get the toilet.  


This can be due to certain medical conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and multiple sclerosis or can be a separate condition. 


It is more common in elderly women.


Stress incontinence


It refers to the leakage of urine due to pressure exerted by urethra and bladder on weak pelvic floor muscle.


It involves leakage of urine during exercise, coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting heavy objects. 


Any form of physical activity and sudden bodily movements also increases the chances of leakage of urine.


Being overweight and prostate surgery also increases the chances of stress incontinence. 


It mostly affects people who are active in sports. 


Functional incontinence


In this type, the patient leaks urine due to his/her inability to reach the washroom on time.


This can happen due to some physical disability such as arthritis, a barrier in the environment or memory problem. 


This type of incontinence is also known as toileting difficulty. 


It mostly occurs in older people who have a normal bladder normal control but having other disabilities make it hard to reach the washroom on time. 


Overflow incontinence


In this, leakage occurs when the bladder is overfilled than its capacity. 


This can happen due to blocked urethra which leads to the incomplete emptying of the bladder. 


The increased urine production in some conditions such as diabetes can also cause overflow incontinence. 


Mixed urinary incontinence

It is the involuntary leakage of urine caused by a combination of stress and urge urinary incontinence. 
","Risk Factors For Urinary Incontinence
Various risk factors that can increase the risk of UI include:  
1. Medical conditions
Urinary tract infection: An infection of the urinary tract (urethra, ureters, bladder and kidneys) can cause urinary incontinence. This is temporary and goes away once the condition is treated. UTIs are very common in women. Are you at high risk of the same?Find out now. 
Tap to know
Pelvic floor disease: The weak pelvic floor muscles in women during certain conditions can also make it hard for the bladder to hold urine and can be a cause of urinary incontinence. 
Stroke: Stroke can affect various muscles of the body including the one that controls the urinary bladder. This can also cause urinary incontinence. 
Diabetes: The increase in the amount of urine in diabetes can also cause urinary incontinence. 
Menopause: During menopause, there are changes in the hormones that can impact the bladder and cause urinary incontinence. 
Pregnancy: Urinary incontinence is very commonly seen during pregnancy as the expanding uterus puts pressure on the bladder. This usually subsides within a few weeks after delivery. 
Multiple sclerosis:This condition disrupts the nerve signals that direct the movement of urine in your body and can cause urinary incontinence. 
Enlarged prostate: The enlargement of the prostate gland puts pressure on the bladder and causes leakage of urine. 
Constipation: Constipation for a long period of time can also cause urinary incontinence. 
Obesity/overweight: Being obese or overweight puts more pressure on the bladder which is not able to hold urine can also be a reason for urinary incontinence. 
Birth defects: There are certain birth defects that can also cause urinary incontinence such as bladder exstrophy in which the bladder develops outside the fetus.
Chronic cough: The persistent cough also puts pressure on the abdomen and that can also cause leakage of urine.  
Genitourinary fistulas:  It is an abnormal connection or passageway between the urinary and genital structures. This condition is also associated with urinary incontinence and is often treated with surgery. 
Surgery: Some surgical procedures such as surgery of prostate gland can also cause urinary incontinence. 
2. Nerve damage

It is the most common cause of functional incontinence. Nerve carries signals from brain to bladder and muscles of urinary bladder. The brain decides when to urinate. Any damage in the nerve can cause involuntary release of urine. The nerve damage can occur in various conditions such as: 


Diabetes


Vaginal childbirth


Parkinson’s disease


Multiple sclerosis


Alzheimer’s disease


Brain or spinal cord injury


Anxiety 


Heavy metal poisoning


3. Lifestyle factors

There are certain lifestyle factors that can cause urinary incontinence. These include:


Consuming food that cause constipation


Drinking excessive caffeinated beverages and alcohol


Physical inactivity


Smoking

4. Medications

Urinary incontinence can also result as a side effect of certain medications such as antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants and hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.",,"Prevention Of Urinary Incontinence
There is no sure shot way to prevent urinary incontinence. However, several factors that act as a trigger for urinary incontinence can be minimized by some lifestyle modifications. These include: 
1. Modify your eating habits
The healthy eating habits helps in the prevention of obesity and diabetes that acts as a trigger for developing urinary incontinence. The follow eating habits should be followed to prevent UI:


Limit alcohol, spicy foods, chocolate, artificial sweeteners, caffeinated beverages as they may cause irritation and inflammation of the bladder.


Include high fiber foods such as wholegrain cereals (such as porridge, brown rice, wholemeal pasta, wholemeal bread or pulses such as lentils and beans) to avoid constipation. Aim for at least 25-30 gms of fiber each day. 


Eat fruits and vegetables to keep the process of defecation easy.


2. Keep yourself hydrated
The lesser intake of water is also associated with constipation and bladder irritation. This can act as a risk factor for developing UI. To prevent dehydration:


Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water every day


Drink more water in hot weather and after strenuous exercise


Make a habit of frequently sipping water even when you are not feeling thirsty


The color of the urine helps in identifying whether the person is taking an adequate amount of water or not. The pale yellow color of the urine indicates that the person is adequately hydrated. Dehydration is characterized by the dark yellow color of the urine. 
Note: Some medications, vitamins and foods can also affect the color of urine.
3. Indulge in some physical activity
It is always advised to indulge in some kind of exercise as it helps to maintain a healthy weight which reduces pressure on the pelvic floor muscles. This helps in reducing the chances of UI. 
Physical activity also helps in preventing constipation which acts as a trigger for UI. Suggestions for physical activity include:


Include a brisk 30 minute walk every day


Pick any physical activity that you enjoy as it helps you to stick to a regular regimen


Include pelvic floor exercises to strengthen the muscles


4. Follow good toilet habits
Urinary incontinence can be prevented by adopting some good toilet habits which includes:


Avoid holding urine for a long period of time 


Take as much as you need and empty the bladder fully


Sit in the full crouching squat position while urinating 


Go to the toilet when the bladder is full


Avoid pushing your pelvic floor muscles to push the urine


Avoid straining during passing stools as it may weaken the pelvic floor muscles


Use correct posture while passing urine which involves an upright sitting with elevated feet


5. Quit smoking
Smoking affects the health of the bladder and it increases the chances of urinary incontinence. Avoiding smoking is known to be associated with decreasing the risk of UI.","Treatment Of Urinary Incontinence

The treatment plan is created according to the type of incontinence. 
A. Medications
There are various medications that are used to reduce leakage. The medications are selected according to the needs of the patient. Some medications stabilize the muscle contractions of the bladder while some work by relaxing muscles of the bladder. This allows the complete emptying of the bladder. Some common examples of medications include: 


Antimuscarinics ( darifenacin, solifenacin, oxybutynin, tolterodine, fesoterodine, and trospium)


Alpha-adrenergic agonist (phenylpropanolamine)


Antidepressants (duloxetine)


Alpha-adrenergic antagonists (terazosin and tamsulosin)


Beta-adrenergic agonist (mirabegron)


B. Vaginal estrogen creams
As the name suggests, these creams are directly applied to the vaginal walls and urethral tissue that helps in relieving urge or stress incontinence.  
C. Hormone replacement therapies
It is most commonly used in women to restore normal bladder function. One such example includes estrogen replacement therapy during menopause. 
D. Other procedures and surgeries
If lifestyle, behavioral and pharmacological (medications) therapy fails to treat the conditions, then some invasive techniques are used. These techniques can range from the use of simple injections to complicated surgeries that are selected as per the cause and symptoms of incontinence. 
Bulking agents: This involves injecting a permanent substance into the lining of the urethra which helps in increasing its lining. It is mostly used in women with stress incontinence. 
Botulinum toxin injections: This involves injecting botulinum toxin into the bladder which relaxes its muscles. It is used to treat urge incontinence. 
Medical devices: This involves the implantation of several devices such as: 


Neuromodulation devices: There are various devices that can modulate the nerve control to the bladder such as pacemakers. In some cases, nerves near the ankle are stimulated to achieve bladder control. 


Artificial urethral sphincter: It is a device that is placed closed to the urethra to control urination. These types of devices are typically used in men with stress incontinence usually after prostate cancer surgery. 


Vaginal insert: There are devices that can be placed in the vagina to compress the urethra. It helps in reducing stress incontinence in women.


Biofeedback sensor: This technique uses sensors to make the patient aware of the urine signals. It may help to regain control on the muscles of the bladder and urethra.
Electrical nerve stimulation: This technique sends electrical signals to the nerves present around the bladder that helps in controlling urine. 
Catheterization: This involves the use of a catheter to drain the urine. A catheter is a tube that is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. It can be used occasionally or on a constant basis.
Surgery: It may be required in some cases such as when incontinence is caused by an enlarged prostate.","Home-care For Urinary Incontinence
Home remedies
Magnesium: It plays an important role in the proper functioning of muscles and nerves. It reduces spasms of the bladder and allows its complete emptying.  It is found to reduce the symptoms of urinary incontinence, especially nocturia. 
The people having incontinence issues should take magnesium-rich foods in their diet which include corn, potatoes, and bananas. 
Vitamin D: The low levels of Vitamin D is associated with weak pelvic floor disorders including urinary incontinence. Patients of UI are advised to take sufficient amounts of Vitamin D as it has shown to reduce its symptoms. 
Here’s the right way to take Vitamin D.

","Living With Urinary Incontinence
Urinary continence can be a cause of embarrassment for many and a hindrance to many daily activities. Here are a few tips that can help in living with urinary incontinence:
1. Timed voiding
Practice going to the bathroom on a regular time interval instead of waiting for the urge to go. This will prevent the overfilling of the bladder and thus reduces the chances of incontinence.
2. Emptying before physical activities 
The patients of urinary incontinence are advised to empty their bladder before doing any physical activities such as running, jumping, or doing any form of exercise. This will reduce the chances of leakage. 
3. Avoid heavy lifting
Most people tend to leak urine while lifting heavy objects. People suffering from urinary incontinence should avoid lifting heavy objects. If any heavy object is needed to move, take help. 
4. Regulate the intake of caffeinated beverages
Caffeinated beverages such as tea and coffee trigger the leakage of urine. It is advised to limit their intake especially before starting an activity. If you are frequently waking up in the night to urinate, avoid these drinks right before going to bed. 
5. Wear pads 
There are various pads and products available in the market that are specially designed to absorb leaked urine. It can be worn to avoid the leakage of urine through the clothes. 
6. Maintain a healthy weight
Being overweight can also be the cause of incontinence. It is advised to maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise. 
7. Keep yourself hydrated 
Inadequate fluid intake can also cause urinary incontinence. Keep yourself hydrated throughout the day by drinking at least 8 glasses of water in a day. 
8. Prevent constipation
Long term constipation can also stimulate the leakage of urine. It is advised to have a diet rich in fiber such as wholegrains, cereals, fruits, and vegetables to prevent constipation.

","Symptoms Of UTIs

Urinary tract infections usually do not cause any signs and symptoms in its early course. However, there are certain symptoms which every woman needs to be aware of and book an appointment with a gynecologist if the symptoms fail to improve in a day or two with home treatment. Each type of UTI may result in more-specific signs and symptoms depending on which part of your urinary tract is infected which are:


Kidneys (acute pyelonephritis)


Bladder (cystitis)


Urethra (urethritis)


The common signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection include:


A strong and persistent urge to urinate


Experiencing a burning sensation while urinating


Appearance of cloudy urine


Strong-smelling urine


Feeling of not able to empty your bladder completely


Appearance of blood in the urine


A sudden urge to urinate


Feeling pain when you urinate


Experience lower back pain

","Causes Of UTIs

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most common bacterial infections. Escherichia coli is the common bacteria that cause UTIs in most patients. Other common causative pathogens include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. 
 
It usually occurs when bacteria enters the urinary bladder through the urethra and starts multiplying inside. Though most of the time, the urinary system of our body by design keeps out these bacteria, sometimes it fails. A full-grown infection of the urinary tract manifests when the body fails to deal with the infection. 
Some of the common causes of UTIs include:


Holding urine for long hours


Following poor vaginal hygiene, especially during menstruation


Suffering from health conditions such as diabetes, dehydration, etc


Experiencing irregular bowel movement or constipation


Not following proper hygiene practices post sexual activity

","Risk Factors For UTIs

Urinary tract infections  (UTIs) are more common in women than in men. This could be attributed to the fact that women have shorter urethras than men. The shortness of the urethra, with its close relationship to the anus, makes it easy for bacteria to ascend in the urinary tract. Other factors that can up the risk of UTI include:


Changes in vaginal pH can trigger bacterial growth


Menopause causes a significant reduction in estrogen secretion which alters vaginal pH


Diabetes is correlated with the development of asymptomatic bacteriuria


Frequent sexual activity and having new sexual partners


Use of spermicides or diaphragm for birth control for contraception may irritate the vagina and urethra and facilitate the entry and colonization of bacteria


Other factors include age of the first UTI, maternal history of UTI and voiding dysfunction


In addition to these common factors, there are few other risk factors for UTI infection in women. These are: 


Abnormalities of the urinary tract


Poor immunity


Blockage of the urinary tract (due to kidney stones, etc)


Use of a catheter


Any recent surgery of the urinary tract

Some of the self care measures for UTI you can follow include:


Use a hot water bottle to ease discomfort and pain.


Drink plenty of water. Aim for 8-12 glasses everyday.


Urinate when you first feel the need. Bacteria can grow when urine stays in the bladder too long.


Wear cotton underwear and loose fitting clothes so that air can circulate and keep the area dry.


Take Vitamin C. It increases the acid in urine so that bacteria cannot grow easily.


Avoid chocolate, citrus, carbonated drinks and caffeine as these can irritate the lining of your bladder and it is easier for bacteria to survive.

","Complications Of UTIs

If left untreated, UTI can last for several months. Moreover, there is a high chance that the infection might spread to other parts of the body such as the kidneys, which can lead to kidney infection. It can lead to recurrent infections, especially in the case of women. Also, in rare cases, it can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening infection of the blood which can lead to severe complications.","Alternative Therapies Of UTIs

Home remedies for UTI

Parsley: It acts as a diuretic and flushes your kidneys which in turn flush out the bacteria and speed up the healing process of UTI. Boil about 1-2 cups of water and add roughly 1 cup of fresh parsley or 2 tbsp of dried parsley. Allow it to simmer, strain and drink. In the summer you can refrigerate it and then have it.Celery seeds: These also act as a diuretic and chewing a handful of them can help increase the production of urine. Once or twice a day you can snack on celery seeds after your meal.Cucumbers: They have high water content and it is a great way to get that extra fluid through your system when you are having a hard time drinking enough water. Have cucumber juice with a dash of ginger juice or include cucumbers in your salad.Probiotics: Probiotics are now considered as a major home remedy for fighting UTI causing bacteria. Studies suggest that benign bacterial flora helps to prevent increase of microorganisms that cause illness. Increase consumption of probiotics such as yoghurt, raw cheese, kimchi, kefir in your diet.Garlic: Enriched with several properties, garlic serves as a rich source of allicin due to which it exhibits antibacterial properties. Daily intake of garlic clove has been found to be beneficial in averting such infections.Cranberry: Studies show that cranberries can help to inhibit the growth and colonization of bacteria that cause infection, including E.coli , the most common bacteria seen in urinary tract infection.

","Symptoms Of Urticaria
Urticaria, also known as hives, typically manifests as red or skin-colored lumps or welts with distinct borders. They can be as small as a pen tip or as huge as a dinner plate. Pressing the center of a red hive can cause it to become white, this is known as blanching. They may appear as a single hive or as blotches or linked patches. It appears to help in regulating the body's allergic reaction to certain stimuli.It is common for people to mistake hives for other conditions, but they are distinguished by a few characteristics. You can determine whether hives are causing a rash or skin disease based on how long they last and how much they move. The following symptoms are commonly associated with hives.


Red or skin-colored lumps or welts with distinct borders that usually disappear within 24 hours but may return to another location.


Bumps or welts that appear alone or in clusters, covering a greater area.


Itchiness and/or swelling in the area of the bumps or welts.


Pain or stinging may occur at the site of the pimples or welts.

",,"Causes Of Urticaria
The disease's etiology might be caused by a variety of reasons. Factors that are frequently encountered include:

1. Medications
Urticaria can be caused by certain medicines such as:


Penicillin


Aspirin


Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs


Sulfonamides


Thiazide diuretics


Oral contraceptives


Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors


Vitamins


Codeine


Morphine


Curare and its derivatives


Synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone


Radiocontrast agents 


Urticaria rashes may appear anywhere from 1–2 hours to 15 days after oral consumption of the medicine or drug. They appear faster when medicines are administered intravenously as compared to oral administration.

2. Foods

Foods that are common causes of urticaria include:


Nuts


Eggs


Fish


Shellfish


Chocolate


Meat 


Cow's milk


Fruits (citrus fruits, grapes, plums, pineapples, bananas, apples, and strawberries)


Vegetables (tomatoes, garlic, onions, peas, beans, and carrots)


Mushrooms


Fermented foods


Spices


Spirits 


Note: Preservatives such as azo dyes, benzoic acid derivatives, salicylates, and food colors are also major causal factors. Urticaria generally appears 1–2 hours after intake of food. Children are more likely to develop food-related urticarial rashes.

3. Respiratory allergens
Urticaria can be induced by the inhalation of allergens like:


Pollen


Mold spores


Mites


Animal dandruff


Animal hairs 


Note: Smoking is also a significant component since it includes numerous chemicals that might aggravate urticaria. Urticaria induced by respiratory allergens often develops shortly after contact.

4. Medical conditions

Urticaria can be caused by infections such as:


Sinusitis


Tonsillitis


Dental abscesses


Urinary tract infections


Hepatitis


Infectious mononucleosis


Note: Urticaria is caused by parasites, particularly in youngsters.

5. Contact urticaria

Urticaria can be caused through contact with:


Latex


Cosmetics


Chemicals


6. Insect bites 
Insect bites may also cause urticaria, particularly in children.

7. Psychogenic factors
Stress, sorrow, and despair can worsen pre-existing urticaria as well as cause it.

8. Systemic disorders
Systemic disorders, in particular, can induce persistent urticaria. Thyroid and rheumatic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, lymphoma, leukemia, and carcinomas may be examined if necessary. It should be mentioned that urticaria can arise during pregnancy.

9. External stimuli 
Stimuli like pressure, heat, cold, and dermographism can all cause urticaria. Urticaria caused by pressure usually appears 3-4 hours after exposure. As a result, they are known as delayed pressure urticaria.

10. Hereditary urticaria
Urticaria can be hereditary and manifest in forms such as angioedema and familial cold urticaria.

11. Idiopathic urticaria
Sometimes, urticaria may occur because of unrecognized causes.Skin allergies can be caused due to various factors that range from changes in weather to exposure to environmental toxins. Let us understand some of the common causes of skin allergies in children.Read To Know!","Diagnosis Of Urticaria
Urticaria can be diagnosed by a variety of medical specialists, although family doctors make the majority of diagnoses (general practitioners). 

Physical examination

A dermatologist diagnoses hives through a physical examination. However, in general, no particular tests are available to diagnose hives. This is due to the non-specific or idiopathic character of triggers in many cases. In certain situations, a trigger – such as a kind of medicine – can be discovered. If an outbreak of hives clears after discontinuing the drug, it can be determined whether it is a trigger. If it does not, the medicine is not the likely culprit.A doctor will gather full medical history and perform a symptom discussion during the appointment in order to try to establish an underlying cause of hives, such as an allergic response, followed by a thorough physical examination.The questions a doctor may ask during a consultation are:


How long have the symptoms been present?


How did the skin marks seem when they initially appeared?


Have the marks altered in any way (for example, size or form) since then?


Is there anything that has made your symptoms better or worse before your consultation?


Do the skin blemishes irritate, burn, or sting?


Before this consultation, have any markings vanished without leaving another trace, such as a bruise?


Have you been tested for allergies? If so, which?


Has a similar skin issue ever developed or happened before?


Have you tried any new meals for the first time?


Have any new goods been launched for the first time such as cleaning detergents?


Have you been bitten or stung by an insect lately?


Are you presently taking any new drugs (prescription or over-the-counter, including herbal supplements)?


Has a new pet been brought into the house?


Is there anyone in your family who has had a similar sort of skin problem?


Allergy test
The doctor will then do a physical examination and assess the skin marks (those that are present). If allergies are suspected, a skin prick test to detect the chemical causing the response may be done. The trigger may be very easily identified if urticarial rashes occur within a short period after intake of shellfish or peanuts, or exposure to sunshine or water, after a scrape to the skin, or after vigorous activity.Once a trigger allergen has been identified, the doctor will advise avoiding coming into contact with or eating a specific food, as well as other items produced from or containing the chemical. If judged safe, the doctor may prescribe an oral food/drug test, in which the afflicted individual is asked to the suspected allergen (in a defined amount) in order to elicit a hive reaction. The patient is monitored closely throughout the test, with emergency equipment or medicine on standby. If there are significant chances of serious responses, such as anaphylaxis, these tests may not be conducted. If you experience any symptoms of allergy, get an allergy panel done.Book Test Here!
Blood tests
Blood tests may also be advised to screen for certain diseases known to be related to hive outbreaks and to analyze blood proteins for a possible genetic tendency (as in the case of hereditary angioedema). A urine sample is occasionally collected as well.Note: Laboratory studies generally are not indicated for acute urticaria (< 6 weeks).In the event of chronic hives, the following tests may be advised as applicable:


Complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of anemia or any infections.


Thyroid function test to determine if the thyroid is hyperactive or underactive (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism).


Tests for liver function to look for any underlying liver condition.


Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test is used to determine the rate of erythrocyte sedimentation (to assess any immune system abnormalities).


Stool test to assess for or identify any parasites causing an infection


Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test to rule out autoimmune disorders such as lupus.


Angioedema tests
C1 esterase inhibitor test (this test evaluates complement protein levels and helps detect any underlying causes of edema) and complement components (C2 and C4) to screen for deficits. Low amounts of these components might cause symptoms of edema and inflammation in the body. 

Solar hives (urticaria) test

Photo-testing: A doctor or allergist can evaluate skin responses to UV radiation from a sun lamp using a range of wavelengths. The wavelength to which the skin reacts will be utilized to identify the type of solar allergy.Patch testing: It involves applying certain chemicals (a suspected sensitizer agent that may cause a response) to the skin and covering it with a patch or dressing for a period of time (usually 24 to 48 hours). The region will next be examined to determine the likelihood of a response. After that, the skin may be exposed to UV light (radiation) via a sun lamp. If the skin responds, solar hives can be diagnosed.In symptoms, autoimmune or metabolic signals may be checked by blood samples (and occasionally skin biopsies) to establish an underlying cause.

Cholinergic hives tests



An exercise challenge test: The patient may be asked to complete an exercise program in order to elicit a comparable response. During the challenge, medical devices may also be used to obtain various measures.




A passive warming test: During the exposure test, a doctor would use warm water or increased ambient temperature to elevate the patient's internal body temperature and monitor a probable reaction.




A skin test for methacholine: Methacholine, a non-selective muscarinic receptor, would be administered to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and monitor a potential response.


Other tests
Other studies that may be considered include the following:


Imaging studies: These are generally not indicated unless suggested by a specific symptom or sign.


Punch biopsy: It is advised if urticarial vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) is suspected.


Extensive testing is not generally recommended by medical specialists in the event of minor hive breakouts or a single incident. Chronic hives are seldom associated with an allergic reaction (due to the frequency of recurrences, which can last for more than 6 weeks). It is more likely that the reason is not of external origin. Relevant tests are performed to identify an underlying cause, which might be an autoimmune illness or another medical condition.","Prevention Of Urticaria
Making lifestyle changes that minimize or prevent hive flare-ups is generally the most effective strategy to lessen the chance of an outbreak or recurrence. It is not always possible to entirely avoid a hive breakout. A confirmed allergy (or a known cause such as medicines, environmental factors, foods, or exposure to specific pets) is a one-way trigger that can be easily avoided. Specific allergy treatment can also be used to minimize the risk and relieve breakouts.If the reason is unknown and flare-ups occur often, maintaining a record that draws parallels between ‘cause and effect' (e.g., food ingested and a probable response) might help discover and avoid potential triggers.


Careful management of sun exposure (refraining from being out in the sun when it is at its strongest – often between 10 am and 4 pm, and gradually increasing time outdoors during the in-between months – spring and autumn or fall – to try and better adapt to stronger sunlight exposure) can be beneficial for solar hives.


Wearing lightweight or loose woven clothes that give maximum covering (long pants or skirts as well as sleeved items).


Wearing clothes with a UPF (ultraviolet) protection rating of at least 40, as well as a broad-spectrum sunscreen recommended by the treating medical professional (and applied regularly).


Maintain your calm. Hives can be triggered by stress. If you are frequently stressed, practice effective stress-reduction strategies including daily exercise, meditation, and mindfulness.


Certain products that may irritate the skin should be avoided. When you have hives, some soaps might cause your skin to dry out and create greater irritation. Make sure you use a mild soap designed for delicate skin. There are many to choose from here. These are generally free of scent and other irritants. You should also avoid using irritants such as heavy moisturizers and creams. When in doubt, use a solution that is designed for sensitive skin. Applying it shortly after washing may also help with itching.


Using anti-sun aids such as sunglasses, broad-brimmed hats, and umbrellas can help to protect against sun rays. 

","Treatment Of Urticaria

If your symptoms are minor, you might not require therapy. Hives and angioedema often resolve on their own. However, therapy can provide relief for severe itching, severe discomfort, or symptoms that linger.

Medications

Prescription medicines, such as those listed below, may be used to treat hives and angioedema.Anti-itch medications (antihistamines)
Antihistamines that do not make you drowsy are the conventional treatment for hives and angioedema. They are the first-line therapy for all urticaria patients.Some class H1 antihistamines with drowsiness as a side effect are:


Chlorpheniramine


Chlorpheniramine Maleate 


Hydroxyzine


Diphenhydramine 


Examples of non-sedating second-generation H1 antihistamines are:


Loratadine


Cetirizine


Terfenadine


Mizolastine 


Second generation H1 antihistamines include:


Desloratadine


Levocetirizine


Fexofenadine


Examples of H2 antihistamines:


Cimetidine


Ranitidine


Famotidine


Nizatidine 


Treatment usually begins with a non-sedating antihistamine during the day and a sedating antihistamine at night. All antihistamines are equally effective in the licensed dosage. If patients do not respond to standard dosage, it is common to double or triple the dose of non-sedating antihistamines. If patients complain of indigestion or acidity, H2 antihistamines might be administered. Combination therapy is frequently beneficial to the patient. In a short experiment, fexofenadine outperformed generic levocetirizine. Many patients do not react to these combinations, necessitating the use of second-line treatments. According to some research, 40% of patients did not respond to antihistamines.Anti-inflammatory medications 
Doctors may occasionally give an oral corticosteroid medication such as prednisone to decrease swelling, redness, and itching caused by severe hives or angioedema.Immune suppressing medications
If antihistamines and corticosteroids do not work, your doctor may prescribe immune suppressing medication that might calm a hyperactive immune system.
Situations of emergency
Acute urticaria may progress to life-threatening angioedema and/or anaphylactic shock in a very short period, although anaphylaxis usually presents as rapid-onset shock with no urticaria or angioedema.A trip to the emergency department and an emergency injection of epinephrine — a kind of adrenaline — may be required if you have a severe episode of hives or angioedema. If you have had a major attack or if your attacks continue after therapy, your doctor may advise you to carry a pen-like device that allows you to self-inject epinephrine in an emergency.If associated bronchospasm is present, prehospital nebulized albuterol may be warranted.Other measures may be appropriate, such as continuous ECG, blood pressure and pulse oximetry monitoring, administering intravenous crystalloids if the patient is hypotensive and administering oxygen.","Home-care For Urticaria
If someone has minor hives or angioedema, the following methods may help ease their symptoms.


People should stay away from triggers and take appropriate precautions. Foods, medicines, pollen, pet dander, latex, and insect bites are the most common triggers. If you suspect a medicine for your rash, discontinue its use and notify the primary care practitioner.


Over-the-counter itch relievers help reduce itching. Some non-prescription antihistamines are loratadine, cetirizine & diphenhydramine.


You can apply a cool washcloth to the affected region to soothe the irritated skin. It also helps avoid scratching.


A relaxing bath in cold water or a cold shower might provide relief from itching. Some people may benefit from bathing in cool water sprinkled with baking soda or oatmeal powder, but this is not a long-term option for chronic itching management.


Dressing in loose-fitting, smooth-textured cotton will help avoid skin irritation.


Staying out of the sun and seeking shade when outside will help prevent aggravation of painful rashes and itching.

",,"Complications Of Urticaria
Urticaria may lead to anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is one of the most serious complications of hives. It is an allergic reaction that is often severe and may even be fatal. It usually happens within seconds to minutes of exposure to a potential allergen such as peanuts or bee stings. An anaphylactic reaction is produced due to a serial release of chemicals by the immune system, which might cause you to go into shock. Anaphylaxis is marked by rapid blood pressure drop and constriction of airways, preventing the sufferer from breathing. The signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis are:


Fast and weak pulse


Skin rash


Nausea and vomiting 


Swelling in the throat can cause a life-threatening obstruction of the airways


Certain foods, some medications, insect venom, and latex are common triggers for anaphylaxis.","Alternative Therapies For Urticaria

How are normal and abnormal vaginal bleeding different?Tap here to know","Causes Of Vaginal Bleeding Between Periods 
 
Bleeding between periods can be caused by an array of causes.
PALM-COEIN is an acronym provided by the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) to classify the underlying causes of abnormal uterine bleeding. 


P: Polyp (small, abnormal growth)


A: Adenomyosis (a condition where the tissue lining the uterus grows into the uterus)


L: Leiomyoma (known as a fibroid, is a noncancerous growth of the uterus)


M: Malignancy (cancer) and hyperplasia (excessive tissue growth)




C: Coagulopathy (impaired blood clotting)


O: Ovulatory dysfunction (a condition where the ovaries do not release eggs regularly)


E: Endometrial disorders (medical conditions affecting the lining of the uterus)


I: Iatrogenic (health problems caused accidentally by medical treatment)


N: Not otherwise classified


A woman with one or more of these listed conditions can have abnormal vaginal bleeding. The various risk factors associated with these factors are described elaborately in the next section.","Risk Factors Of Vaginal Bleeding Between Periods 
1. Hormonal changes


Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): It is a common cause of menstrual irregularities, including spotting between periods. 


Hypothyroidism: An underactive thyroid gland can interrupt regular menstrual cycles and increase the risk of abnormal vaginal bleeding, 


Hyperthyroidism: An overactive thyroid gland is a common risk factor for abnormal uterine bleeding among reproductive-age women.  


Use of Oral Contraceptive Pills: The most common effect of taking oral contraceptive pills during the first few months of use is spotting or bleeding between periods (breakthrough bleeding). 


Being underweight or Obese: Weight affects the body's hormonal balance. Thus, being overweight or underweight or sudden changes in weight can trigger irregular bleeding.

Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT): During the initial stages of HRT or when the dose is adjusted, breakthrough bleeding and spotting are very common.

2. Infections


Vaginitis: It is an inflammation of the vagina that can result in discharge, itching, pain, and spotting between periods. 


Cervicitis: It refers to irritation or infection of the cervix. Bleeding between periods is a common symptom of cervicitis.


Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): It is an infection of the upper reproductive organs, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It can lead to irregular menstrual periods.


Endometriosis: It is an infection in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus or womb called the endometrium starts growing outside the uterine cavity. This can lead to pain, heavy bleeding between periods, and infertility.


Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): STIs like Gonorrhea and Chlamydia can cause bleeding between periods.


Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can also affect fertility in women. Read more about infertility in women.Click here
3. Pregnancy complications


Miscarriage: It refers to loss of pregnancy before the 20th week. It can cause vaginal bleeding or spotting. 


Ectopic pregnancy: A pregnancy that occurs when a fertilized egg grows outside of the uterus. The first warning signs of ectopic pregnancy are vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. 


Placental abruption: This occurs when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus before birth which can cause light, intermittent vaginal bleeding.


Placenta previa: It is a condition during pregnancy where the placenta blocks all or part of the baby's exit from the vagina. The most common symptom of this condition is vaginal bleeding. 


Premature labor: Labor that begins early, before 37 weeks of pregnancy can also cause abnormal vaginal bleeding.

5. Cancers and precancerous conditions


Cervical cancer: In many cases, vaginal bleeding is the first noticeable symptom of cervical cancer. It usually occurs after having intercourse. 


Endometrial hyperplasia: It is a precancerous condition in which there is an irregular thickening of the uterine lining, causing heavy or abnormal bleeding. 


Vaginal cancer: Vaginal cancer may cause signs and symptoms such as unusual vaginal bleeding after intercourse. 


Uterine sarcoma: It is a cancer that starts in the muscle and supporting tissues of the uterus (womb) that can lead to unusual bleeding from the vagina. 


6. Medical conditions


Celiac disease: It is a chronic digestive and immune disorder that damages the small intestine. Many studies have found that celiac disease can lead to spotting between periods. 




Von Willebrand disease (VWD): It is a blood disorder in which the blood does not clot properly. VWD is a common cause of heavy menstrual bleeding and abnormal bleeding between periods. 


7. Certain Medications 


Blood thinners and aspirin: Studies have reported that women taking blood thinners and aspirin have irregular, infrequent, and bleeding between periods. 




Tamoxifen: This drug is prescribed for women undergoing treatment of breast cancer. It may lead to side effects like bloody discharge or unusual vaginal discharge.


8. Other factors


Vaginal dryness: Friction and irritation in the vaginal tissue, may lead to small tears and spotting between periods.


Injury to the vagina: This can happen during sexual activity or the use of certain products, which can lead to bleeding between periods by damaging the delicate vaginal tissue.


Stress: Stress can elevate cortisol levels, impacting sex hormone production and potentially causing spotting.

It could be an option if vaginal bleeding between periods is due to some noncancerous uterine growth such as a polyp, fibroid, or thickening in the endometrium. It includes:


Dilation and curettage (D&C): It is a procedure to remove abnormal tissue from inside the uterus. The cervix is dilated (opened) so that the uterine lining (endometrium) can be scraped with a curette (spoon-shaped instrument). 




Endometrial ablation: It is a procedure that destroys the lining of the uterus. This is recommended for bleeding between the menstrual periods, having a heavy flow, or having periods that last a long time. 


Note: In several cases, the periods will return to normal. However, in a few cases, the period stops completely. 


Myomectomy: It is a surgery to remove uterine fibroids. Myomectomy leaves the uterus intact, so people can still become pregnant after the procedure.




Hysterectomy: It is a surgical procedure that removes the uterus. A woman will no longer be able to get pregnant after a hysterectomy. 




Uterine artery embolization (UAE): This procedure is used to stop vaginal spotting if it is due to underlying medical conditions like uterine fibroids, trauma, cancerous tumors, and childbirth.

","Types of Vaginal Discharge
 
Vaginal discharge is broadly divided into:
I. Normal (Physiological) vaginal discharge
Vaginal discharge is a natural and normal process that helps to keep your reproductive tract clean, lubricated and healthy, warding off any infection. 
The amount, color and consistency of normal vaginal discharge can vary from person to person and where you are in your menstrual cycle:


Days 1–5: During your period or menstruation, the discharge is red and bloody.


Days 6–14: Following a period, vaginal discharge is mostly white or slightly yellow, and sticky.


Days 14–25: A few days before ovulation, the discharge becomes clear, thin, slippery and stretchy, similar to the consistency of egg whites. After ovulation, the discharge goes back to being white or light yellow, and sticky.


Days 25–28: The amount of discharge reduces before the next period.



II. Inflammatory vaginal discharge
This type of leucorrhoea occurs when there is inflammation (redness and swelling) in the vagina caused by microbes.
Various types of vaginal discharge vary in color, amount, consistency, and smell. Some are normal, while others are an indication of an infection that warrants consultation with a doctor. Here you can get an idea of what different discharge can mean:
1. Clear to whitish
Watery, clear to whitish vaginal discharge is normal. It usually becomes more slippery and has the consistency of egg whites during ovulation. The amount and thickness of vaginal discharge can also increase during sexual arousal, pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives.
2. White to cream or light yellow
White to cream or light yellow discharge is mostly a sign of healthy lubrication. However, if the white discharge has a frothy consistency like cottage cheese and is accompanied by a strong smell, it may indicate a yeast/fungal/candida infection, which can also cause severe itching or irritation.
3. Red 
Red discharge occurs during a period or menstruation. However, if bleeding occurs between menstrual periods or after menopause you should consult a doctor on priority.
4. Pinkish to light brown
Pink to light brown discharge mostly occurs as spotting before a period. It can also be a sign of implantation bleeding during early pregnancy. Some pink discharge can be seen after sex if intercourse has caused tears or irritation in the vagina or cervix.
6. Yellow to green
While light yellow discharge may not indicate any illness, darker yellow to green discharge could indicate sexually transmitted infections. Sometimes, the discharge may smell fishy accompanied by itching or burning in or around the vagina.
7. Gray
When you have a gray color discharge with symptoms like pain in the pelvic region or pain while peeing and discomfort or itching around the genital area, it could be a sign of infection called bacterial vaginosis.",,"Risk Factors of Vaginal Discharge

","Symptoms Of Vaginal Yeast Infection 
 
The symptoms can range from mild to moderate and some of the common symptoms of yeast infection are: 


Itching and irritation 


Redness and swelling 


Rash 


White, and thick discharge that resembles cottage cheese


The severity of symptoms depends on the length of the untreated period. In other words, if you leave it without any treatment for a long period it may have a negative effect and lead to more serious health problems such as:


Yeast infection in the vagina leads to abnormal vaginal discharge (thick, white, odor-free vaginal discharge with a cottage cheese appearance)


Itching or soreness of the vagina

Pain or burning when urinating


If it is left untreated or if you have any risk factors, it can lead to a complicated yeast infection with symptoms such as:


Persistent or many yeast infections per year


Swollen or irritated vaginal tissue 


Itching leading to cracks, tears, or sores

","Causes Of Vaginal Yeast Infection 
In many people, Candida fungus is harmless. However, there are certain conditions which may trigger the yeast to cause an infection. Here are some of the most common causes of yeast infections.
1. Hormonal changes 
Hormonal imbalance, especially imbalance in sex hormones like estrogen and progesterone, may affect the balance of fungus and other bacteria in the vagina, causing a yeast infection. It can also happen during pregnancy, breasfeeding, and menopause (if you are on hormone replacement therapyor HRT)
2. Diabetes  
In women with uncontrolled diabetes, there is a higher risk of vaginal yeast infection because excess glucose can act as a food medium for yeast. Also, fungi can grow in any warm, moist fold of skin such as between fingers and toes, under breasts, and in or around sex organs.
3. Poor hygiene 
Poor hygiene and infrequent bathing can allow the yeast to build up in the crevices of the skin. This allows the growth of yeast in sweaty and moist skin, leading to an infection.
4. Tight clothing 
Clothes including undergarments that are too tight or made of a fabric that does not allow the skin to breathe can contribute to the growth of yeast. 
5. A weakened immune system
An immune system that is compromised due to a disorder like HIV infection or medications that suppresses the immune system like steroids and chemotherapy can create opportunities for yeast and fungus to grow unchecked, causing a yeast infection.
6. Medications 
Taking antibiotics for infections like urinary tract infections, can kill beneficial bacteria, leaving space for yeast to grow. In certain conditions, taking medications is necessary and the side effects can weaken the immune system and therefore cause yeast infection. Specifically, corticosteroids are used in treating arthritis, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and allergic reactions increasing the chance of getting a candidiasis. Medications like tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis can increase the chances of getting histoplasmosis. It is an infection caused by a fungus called Histoplasma, which lives particularly in soil that contains large amounts of bird or bat droppings.
7. Sexual intercourse 
Although not common, person with an active yeast infection can pass that infection on to sexual partners through unprotected genital or oral contact. Engaging in sexual activity during a yeast infection can exacerbate the symptoms and also delay the healing process.
8. Stress
Ongoing stress can cause the body to produce elevated levels of cortisol, which can impair the immune system, and the ability to fight infections, and can prolong a yeast infection. Both chronic stress and reduced antioxidant capacity are risk factors for recurrent vaginal yeast infections.","Risk Factors Of Vaginal Yeast Infection 
The risk factors of vaginal yeast infection include women who are:


Are pregnant


Use hormonal contraceptives like birth control pills


Have uncontrolled diabetes 


Are taking or have recently taken antibiotics or immunosuppressive medications like steroids or those used during chemotherapy


Have a weakened immune system due to HIV infection 

","Prevention Of Vaginal Yeast Infection
1. Wearing breathable undergarmentsCotton is the best choice of fabric as it doesn’t hold onto heat or moisture. It helps in keeping you dry and can prevent vaginal or genital yeast infection.  2. Wear loose clothesWearing too tight-fitted clothes like jeans, skirts, underwear, yoga pants, and tights, can boost body temperature and increase the amount of moisture around the private parts. Therefore, it raises the chances of yeast infection.3. Avoid douching The acidic environment protects the vagina from infections or irritation. Feminine hygiene products like douches can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the vagina by removing some of the good bacteria that can fight infections.4. Changing wet clothes immediately Sitting in a wet bathing suit after swimming or damp workout clothes after the gym is not advised as moist and wet clothes have the strongest potential of causing yeast infection. 5. Limiting the use of antibioticsTaking antibiotics for infections like cold and flu can kill off beneficial bacteria, leaving space for yeast to grow.6. Maintaining good personal hygieneAt the time of the menstrual cycle, the overgrowth of yeast infection is high. Changing sanitary napkins, tampons and undergarments are useful and often save the person from recurrent infections. 7. Managing diabetes and high blood pressure The frequency and length of time the blood pressure is greater than 250 mg/dL can be a causative agent of yeast infection; it can be controlled by limiting the salt intake in food and avoiding stress. Diabetes can be managed by keeping an eye on sugar intake. 8. Drinking probiotics and eating yogurt These contain active live cultures of good bacteria and yeast that help in replenishing body’s flora and maintain the growth of yeast infection. Taking supplements with lactobacillus acidophilus may also help prevent them.Vaginal infections are the most common type of yeast infection.

The candida diet is essentially a low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, anti-inflammatory diet that helps to promote good gut health. The following are the foods that need to be added and avoided in diet to promote a healthy lifestyle without yeast infections. 


Protein: This is a mandatory part of the candida diet. Lean cuts of proteins and eggs are an important part of protein sources. 


Remove the problem foods: First, you need to remove the foods from your diet that feed the candida and encourage it to flourish in your body. Foods like sugar, white flour, yeast, and alcohol are believed to promote candida overgrowth. The diet should be mainly centered on vegetables and gluten-free foods like brown rice and millet.


Low sugar fruits only: At times, when the infection is at its peak, avoiding eating fruits because even though fruits are healthy, they get converted into sugar which can trigger growth of yeast. Only selective fruits like berries, lime, lemon, green apples, and avocados can be trusted.


Include green veggies: Green veggies such as cucumber, spinach, asparagus, and capsicum are included in the candida diet plan. All vegetables should be consumed fresh and raw.


Fermented foods: Fermentation is a process that converts all carbohydrates into organic acids. Yogurt is the best example of fermented food. If you have candida, fermented foods are the best as it is also good for digestion.


Replacing all drinks with water: While following the candida diet, it is best to replace all drinks with fresh water.  Drinks containing sugar, fizzy drinks, fruit juices, milkshakes, and hot drinks like tea and coffee should be avoided. Caffeine intake should also be restricted since it elevates the blood sugar levels.


2. Anti-candida supplements 


Probiotics: Yeast infections are usually a result of gut flora imbalances between candida and the friendly organisms that normally control yeast overgrowth. Probiotics supplements work by populating the intestine with beneficial organisms that can help to restore these imbalances. A few examples of probiotics are yogurt, and kefir (a fermented milk drink, it is a better source of probiotics than yogurt, and people with lactose intolerance can often drink kefir with no problems). Other examples of probiotics are traditional buttermilk, and some types of cheese are a rich source of protein, calcium, and Vitamin B12. 


Antifungal supplements: Antifungals and anti-candida supplements contain ingredients that directly or indirectly can kill candida and yeast in the body. A list of antifungals and herbs for candida and yeast infection includes tea tree oil, oregano oil, and coconut oil. The same applies also to natural extracts such as echinacea and astragalus that have immune-boosting abilities, and also have antifungal properties.


3. Medications 
The treatment for vaginal yeast infections depends on the severity and frequency of your infections. For mild to moderate symptoms and infrequent episodes, your doctor might recommend:


Short-term vaginal therapy for three to seven days which usually clears up the infection. These medications are available in the form of ointments, creams, tablets, and suppositories. Common examples include miconazole and terconazole. 


Antifungals may be taken orally as single dose fluconazole or can be applied intravaginally in a single day or 3-day regimen that is available over-the-counter (OTC). 


For severe symptoms and frequent yeast infections, your doctor may recommend:

Long-course vaginal therapy taken for two weeks followed by once a week for six months. The therapy includes intravaginal azole therapy, which is the first line of treatment for many fungal infections. They are often administered for weeks to months. Oral azole drugs like ketoconazole,  fluconazole, and itraconazole represent a major advance in systemic antifungal therapy. 



In case of complicated infection, the administered dose of fluconazole 150 mg is increased as it is given orally, once every 3 days for three doses.


In a few cases of azole-resistant therapy, the doctor might recommend a boric acid capsule, inserted into your vagina. This medication may be fatal if taken orally and is used only to treat candida fungus that is resistant to the usual antifungal agents.

","Complications Of Vaginal Yeast Infection
Some complications occurring due to yeast infection are:
1. Spread to other organs  
The most common complication of a yeast infection is the spreading of yeast infection to other organs. In a few cases, the yeast cells enter the blood and reach the various other organs, leading to many other serious complications like endocarditis, meningitis, and arthritis. The organs commonly affected by Candida are the lungs, liver, heart, brain, joints, and intestine. 
2. Pregnancy complications 
In some cases, vaginal yeast infections may sometimes cause problems with a pregnancy. Pregnant women with yeast infections experience preterm labor, and preterm rupture of membranes. 
3. Urinary tract candidiasis
Candida infection can spread to the urinary tract. One of the rare complications of yeast infection is renal candidiasis. This condition occurs due to the spread of infection through the blood to renal cells.
4. Recurrent infections 
If the infection is not treated properly once, there may be a chance that the infection might come back. Recurrent yeast infections can be disruptive to a person's well-being. It can also cause difficulties in a relationship, if the yeast infections disrupt normal sexual activity.","Alternative Therapies For Vaginal Yeast Infection
 
Several alternative therapies emphasize yeast infection treatment on the elimination of the causes, rather than eliminating the fungus.
1. Aromatherapy 
Aromatherapy is the practice of using the natural oils extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots, or other parts of a plant to get rid of the itching and rashes related to yeast infection. The tea tree oil is widely used to treat a variety of infections and is considered to be one of the more powerful infection-fighting oils. Other oils like clove oil, oregano oil, and lavender oil can also be used. For vaginal infection, 5 to 8 drops of essential oil can be mixed with one liter of water, Use this mixture to perform vaginal douche.
2. Chinese medicine for yeast infection
Acupuncture, herbal therapy, and diet and lifestyle changes offer ways to correct energy imbalances and enhance the body's defenses. Acupuncture and Chinese medicine can also help with combating stress and correcting the body’s imbalances. It also helps the liver and kidney to discharge all the toxins released by the dead yeast.
3. Herbal medicine 
Several herbs can knock out excess fungus, while the others are effective in strengthening the immune system. Goldenseal is one of the most commonly used herbs for its immune-boosting properties, and it is also believed to be effective in stabilizing the overgrowth of fungus. The other herbs useful in eliminating yeast infection are calendula, thyme, rosemary, chamomile, and ginger. These herbs can be taken in the form of capsules, and extracts, or can be added to tea. 
4. Mind/body medicine for yeast infection 
Chronic stress may also lead to too much yeast in the body. It is therefore recommended to relax the mind and reduce stress by meditation. Joining social groups and communities, and engaging in social activities can help modulate the mind and hence reduce stress. ","Living With Vaginal Yeast Infection 
If you frequently have yeast infections, you should discuss them with your healthcare provider. However, it is important to remember that an early diagnosis of yeast infection can help in clearing up the infection with antifungal medication and can save the person from further implications. 


Make sure that the person understands the diagnosis and its health implications. 


Regular checkup is required to evaluate the present infection and whether the person is receiving the right treatment which helps in subsiding the infection.


Routine blood sugar level evaluation is required in case of yeast infection, as yeast overgrows in elevated sugar levels.


Discussion of any possible hormonal changes due to menopause, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy. These changes lead to hormonal imbalance and hence put a person at a greater risk of developing Candida yeast infections.


A test for HIV/AIDS is required if a person is having frequent yeast infection.

 ","Causes Of Varicose Veins
Varicose veins may be caused by weakened valves within the veins that result in the pooling of blood in the veins instead of traveling to the heart. The causes of varicose veins can include:



Primary varicose veins: These can have a hereditary factor like weakness in the wall of the vein and occur in some members of the same family.





Secondary varicose veins: These develop because of secondary causes such as trauma or deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the deeper veins).





Familial and congenital varicose veins: These are due to disorders due to vascular malformation in the limb, present at birth.

",,"Diagnosis Of Varicose Veins

Diagnosing varicose veins requires a thorough history, physical examination, and series of tests. They include:
Complete medical history
This should include previous interventions or surgery on the affected leg, pregnancy, ulcerations, trauma, any history of uterine fibroids and cancer, previous DVT (deep vein thrombosis), past hospital stays, cardiovascular disease, and previous lower limb fracture.

Clinical examination

The clinical evaluation of varicose veins in the standing position and inspected for redness,
tenderness, swelling, hyperpigmentation, and ulcerations. Classification of venous reflux is used to assess the clinical severity of symptoms, it includes:

C0: No visible or palpable signs of venous disease
C1: Reticular veins (purple blue veins)
C2: Varicose veins
C3: Edema (swelling)
C4a: Pigmentation and itching
C4b: Changes in the skin of the lower legs and White scar as a result of healed ulcer
C5: Healed leg ulcer
C6: Active ulcer on the leg

To determine the exact cause the tests include: 



Trendelenberg test: Also known as Brodie–Trendelenburg test, it determines the competency of the valves in the superficial and deep veins of the legs in patients with varicose veins. It is done by elevating the leg to 45º, and a tourniquet is applied to the midthigh after the veins have completely drained.





Perthes test: This is done in a standing position with a tourniquet applied to the midthigh. If the varicose veins collapse after a 5-minute walk or varicose veins become more prominent and painful with walking, then the deep veins are obstructed.



Imaging techniques
If the cause of varicose veins is not clear from the clinical examination or if an intervention is being considered then imaging tests are done. They include:



Venography: It is a procedure of an x-ray of the veins after a special dye is injected into the bone marrow or veins. It is done to find blood clots, and identify a vein for use to assess varicose veins before surgery.





Venous doppler test: This is an ultrasound scan to check the direction of blood flow in the veins and check if there are any blood clots in the veins.





Color duplex ultrasound scan: It involves using high-frequency sound waves to look at the speed of blood flow, and the structure of the veins in the legs.





Computed tomography (CT): It can help find deep, hidden varicose veins and even the root cause behind the symptoms. Studies show that CT venography can provide an excellent road map for varicose veins surgery. 





Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): It can be used as an alternative tool that plays a better role in assessing varicose veins of the lower extremities and deep veins of the pelvis and abdomen.





CT Angiogram: This test can help your doctor confirm whether you have varicose veins or any other problem. A dye is injected that outlines your veins on x-ray images.



Ambulatory venous pressure measurements
It is used to detect the decline in pressure from a higher value in the leg veins. Ambulatory venous pressure (AMVP) measurement is considered the gold standard in evaluating calf pump function in chronic venous disease.

Eat the right diet
Excess salt can cause swelling in the legs. Eating a low-sodium diet with high-fiber foods can help to prevent varicose veins.
Control your blood pressure
High blood pressure puts an extra strain on blood vessels making them more susceptible to becoming varicose veins.
Limit sun exposure
Sun exposure can worsen the appearance of varicose veins and excessive exposure to the sun can cause spider veins (small dilated red or purple veins) on the cheeks or nose in fair-skinned people.
Protect yourself from the harsh rays of the sun. Choose from the widest range of sunscreens that best suit your skin.

Varicose veins treatment requires a correct understanding of the severity of symptoms. The treatment consists of the following:
Conservative management
For individuals with milder symptoms and who do not want to undergo surgery using long-term graduated compression stockings, leg elevation, and oral pain medications can be a means to relieve the symptoms. Stockings should be worn daily if you want to see results and avoid surgery.
Surgical management
For patients with symptomatic veins and substantial venous incompetence, surgery has been the optimal treatment for many years. Traditional surgical treatment consisted of the following:



Conventional surgery: A small incision is made in the groin crease and the top of the main incompetent vein is dissected and tied off. A fine plastic wire is passed through the vein and retrieved through the inside of the leg at the knee level.




Vein stripping: This procedure is used to remove or tie off a large vein in the leg that helps treat varicose veins.




Radiofrequency and laser ablation: These involve passing a probe up the long vein from knee level to the groin under ultrasound guidance and then ablating the vein in sections. This avoids a groin incision and may lead to less bruising and quicker recovery. 




Sclerotherapy: This involves the injection of an agent called sclerosant into varicosities, followed by a period of compression bandaging and/or compression hosiery. The main risk of sclerotherapy is injection outside the vein, which can result in local tissue necrosis and scarring.




Foam sclerotherapy: This involves mixing sclerosant with a small quantity of air to produce a foam that spreads rapidly and widely through the veins, pushing the blood aside and causing the veins to go into spasm.


Minimally invasive procedures


Endovascular Laser Ablation( EVLA): This is a preferable treatment usually for larger varicose veins in which a thin catheter inserted into an enlarged vein heats the tip of the catheter using radiofrequency energy. As the catheter is pulled out, the heat destroys the vein by causing it to collapse and shut.




Micropuncture or micro-incision or stab phlebectomy: In this procedure, a physician makes a tiny incision and uses a surgical instrument or a large needle to hook the problem vein through the opening. The vein is then removed a tiny piece at a time.




Transilluminated powered phlebectomy: The procedure involves inserting a light under the skin while simultaneously injecting a mixture of saline and a local anesthetic that guides the surgeon to cut the vein into smaller pieces and suction the pieces from the space.


Management of spider veins
Many patients will have visible superficial veins referred to as ""spider veins"". These may not be a cause of worry just for cosmetic sake but can also be painful. Its management includes:



Liquid sclerotherapy: It involves the injection of a liquid sclerosant into the superficial veins. 




Phlebectomy: It involves removing larger superficial varicose veins through small 2 mm to 3 mm incisions.


Laser therapy: Laser light can destroy the vein without damaging your skin. Laser therapy is only used to treat spider veins and is not useful for varicose veins.

","Symptoms Of Vertigo 

Vertigo is not a disease but a symptom of an underlying condition. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and vary from person to person depending on the cause of vertigo. Vertigo can also lead to or occur alongside other symptoms:


When a person feels he/she is spinning or the world around him/her is spinning


A feeling of abnormal balance or a loss of balance


A sensation of dizziness or swaying


Giddiness or feeling faint


Increased sweating


A sensation of nausea that may or may not be accompanied by vomiting


Headaches


A feeling of fullness in the ear


Ringing in the ears or pain in the ears, or loss of hearing


Abnormal or jerky eye movements called nystagmus

","Causes Of Vertigo

The ear is the organ responsible for maintaining vestibular equilibrium in the body. The innermost part of the ear, called the inner ear, has 3 loop-shaped structures called ‘semicircular canals’ which are responsible for the orientation of the body with respect to movements of the head. Any issue that causes a disturbance in these semicircular canals can lead to vertigo. This type of vertigo which is associated with the inner ear or the vestibular nerve, which connects the inner ear and the brain is called peripheral vertigo.This is the most common type of vertigo.Neurological problems such as brain tumors, stroke, cervical spondylosis, multiple sclerosis, etc., cause central vertigo. The various causes of vertigo are discussed as follows:1. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)


Benign: not dangerous to health


Paroxysmal: presents as a sudden, brief episode


Positional: set off by particular head or bodily movements


Vertigo: an internal sense of irregular or spinning movement either of oneself or of the surroundings


BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. It is a harmless condition that presents as mild to intense dizziness lasting for a few seconds or minutes. It is often associated with a sudden change in the position of the head or body, like bending over, turning in bed, or sitting up. BPPV usually resolves on its own and is not serious.The inner ear is a system of canals filled with fluid that lets the brain know about movements of the head. In BPPV, small calcium crystals in the inner ear move out of place. Hence, the system is not able to send the correct signals to the brain.BPPV can happen because of a head injury or aging as well. The natural breakdown of cells that happens with age or during injury is thought to be responsible for this.2. Meniere’s disease
This is a rare condition that causes severe vertigo, nausea, ringing in the ears, muffled or distorted hearing, hearing loss, and feeling of a plugged ear. This condition is characterized by excess fluid buildup in the inner ear. Meniere’s attacks usually happen suddenly and can last from 20 minutes to 24 hours. Patients also feel worn out after the attack passes.3. Ear infections
Viral and less commonly bacterial infections can cause inflammation of the nerves in the ears. The vestibulocochlear nerve, a nerve in the inner ear, has two branches:


The vestibular nerve sends signals to the brain about balance. Its inflammation leads to vestibular neuritis.


The cochlear nerve sends signals about hearing. Its inflammation causes labyrinthitis.


This inflammation hinders the messages the nerves of the ear take to the brain. Hence, the symptoms of vertigo are experienced.Rarely, another viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus can lead to Herpes zoster oticus, a type of shingles. It is an infection of the inner, middle, and external ear caused by the spread of the virus to the facial nerves. This leads to various symptoms of vertigo. In case it paralyzes the muscles of the face, it is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome.4. Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma): 
It is a benign tumor that develops on the vestibular or cochlear nerves leading from the inner ear to the brain. The pressure on the nerve from the tumor may cause vertigo.5. Vestibular migraine
Migraines are often characterized by painful headaches, however vestibular migraine may or may not involve headaches along with vestibular symptoms such as vertigo and imbalance. People with vestibular migraine do report common migraine symptoms, such as sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound etc.6. Cholesteatoma
Repeated ear infections, skull or facial bone birth abnormalities or an injury to the eardrum can result in a noncancerous skin growth in the middle ear. This growth is called a cholesteatoma, and as it grows behind the eardrum, it can damage the bony structures of the middle ear. This can lead to the symptoms of vertigo.7. Perilymphatic fistula
The middle ear is filled with air whereas the inner ear is filled with fluid called perilymph. Usually, thin membranes separate the inner and middle ear. A tear in these membranes is called a perilymph fistula (PLF) which causes perilymphatic fluid from the inner ear to flow into the middle ear thereby affecting balance and hearing.8. Central nervous system (CNS) disorders
Neurological conditions such as brain tumors, stroke, transient ischemic attack, cervical spondylosis, seizures, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis etc., can also cause vertigo.9.Trauma
Concussion and head trauma or any trauma during ear surgery can also cause vertigo.10. Syphilis
Late neurosyphilis may affect the ear leading to hearing loss, fluctuating hearing, or vertigo.",,,,,"Specialist To Visit

Most cases of vertigo are mild and occur as a one-off episode. Such patients do not need to visit a doctor as vertigo often resolves on its own. However, if the vertigo is long-lasting, interferes with the ability to live a normal life, is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, headaches, weakness in the hands or legs, speech difficulties, hearing loss, it is essential to seek medical care.

Often, episodes of vertigo are mild and resolve on their own without requiring treatment. In case the attacks do not go away or are so severe that they interfere with a patient’s day-to-day activities, treatment is needed. The treatment for vertigo depends on the cause and severity of the symptoms.
Antivertigo medications: These are a group of medications that are known to relieve vertigo (dizziness). One of the most commonly used drugs to treat vertigo arising out of Meniere’s disease is betahistine. It improves the blood flow to the inner ear and reduces the pressure of the excess fluid, which causes the symptoms of vertigo. Other examples include cinnarizine.
 
Antiemetics: This is a class of drugs that help ease the symptoms of nausea and vomiting, frequently associated with Vertigo. Some of the commonly used preparations that are effective against nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo include


Promethazine


Ondansteron


Antibiotics: If the cause for vertigo is a middle or inner ear infection, it must be treated with antibiotics to resolve the infection, and thereby vertigo. Oral antibiotics and antibiotic ear drops help fight bacterial infections of the ear, thereby reducing the inflammation that causes Vertigo.
Vestibular suppressants: These are medications that reduce the intensity of vertigo due to vestibular imbalance. There are three main categories of drugs.  


Antihistamine preparations are the most commonly prescribed medicines that help reduce symptoms, such as dizziness and can prevent motion sickness.


Anti-anxiety medications like benzodiazepines can also act as vestibular suppressants in low doses and can help reduce the symptoms of an acute vertigo episode. These medicines are not routinely prescribed as their use is restricted to acute severe vertigo episodes or to manage the anxiety associated with vertigo.


Anticholinergic drugs like scopolamine help with dizziness and motion sickness.

","Living With Vertigo

Vertigo can often impose certain restrictions on an individual's lifestyle. As symptoms of Vertigo are aggravated by sudden rapid movements of the head, a person with vertigo may not be able to enjoy adventure activities like joyrides and may face aggravated motion sickness, which may hinder traveling. Patients with vertigo may also be sensitive to bright lights, loud, and startling noises. Thus, they may not interact well in crowds or noisy places.
Severe forms of vertigo that impair balance may predispose the patient to increased chances of falls and complications arising out of such falls.","Home-care For Vertigo

 A one-off episode of vertigo does not require any special care. However, if the episodes are severe and frequent, the patient needs to take utmost care.


Avoid sudden, jerky movements of the head and neck.


Sit down or lie down immediately when symptoms occur.


Use walking aids, such as a cane or walking stick if you have severe vertigo and have an increased risk of falling.


Avoid places with crowds, bright lights, and loud startling noises.


Sleep with your head slightly raised on 2 or more pillows. 


Get out of bed slowly and sit on the edge of the bed for a while before standing up. Try to relax because anxiety can worsen vertigo.


Do not bend over to pick things up. Squat to lower yourself instead.


Do not stretch your neck - for example , while reaching up to a high shelf.

","Symptoms Of Warts
Warts are lesions/bumps in the skin and the thin skin that covers the inside surface of parts of the body, such as the nose and mouth.  Warts have a very long incubation period (the period from virus exposure to the onset of symptoms). It generally ranges from 1 to 6 months but can even take up to 12 months. These lesions appear as skin growth with an irregular surface. Their size can range from 1 mm to several cm.The other general signs and symptoms of warts include: 

The presence of small and rough bumps on skin
Appearance of long threads or thin fingers on the skin
The presence of black dots that appear like seeds
Mild bleeding from bumps
Itching
Tightness or feeling of pressure

The lesions can appear alone (solitary) or in groups (mosaic). The most common sites of these warts are hands and feet. However, they occur in other body parts, depending on the type. The characteristic of these lesions depends upon the type of the warts and include:
1. Common warts (vurruca vulgaris)


Dome shaped nodules 


Mainly located on fingers, hands, knees, elbows, or any other sites of trauma


It can also appear as thin and long outgrowths around the eyelids and lips

Warts are caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Although HPV has over 100 subtypes, only a few cause skin warts. 
Warts can be transmitted easily through direct or indirect contact. The transmission of the virus is fast through disrupted and soft skin. The mode of transmission includes: 


Touching the skin of the infected person


Doing unprotected sexual intercourse


Touching contaminated objects such as towels and razor


Using communal bathrooms and swimming pools


Sharing sex toys


What happens after the exposure?
Once HPV has infected the skin, it spreads to other parts through scratching, shaving, or injuries. The virus can enter the skin and multiply in its uppermost layer. It makes the outer layer of the skin thick and complex, and it protrudes as a wart.
 
A few subtypes of HPV have the potential to induce cancer. These strains include type 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, and 35. Individuals who are immunocompromised are more prone to transformation of warts into cancer. ","Diagnosis Of Warts 
The diagnosis of warts include:
1. Clinical examination 
Each type of wart has a characteristic feature and location.  Almost all cases of warts are diagnosed through physical examination by a trained clinician. 
2. Dermoscopy
It refers to the examination of skin using a high quality magnifying lens and a powerful lighting system (a dermatoscope). It reveals abnormalities of the skin. 
3. Immunohistochemical (IHC) detection 
It uses antibodies to detect the location of proteins and other antigens in a sample of skin tissue. It confirms the presence of virus in a lesion. 
4. Southern blot hybridization 
It is used to identify the specific HPV type present in tissue. It has higher sensitivity than IHC. 
5. Polymerase chain reaction
It is another confirmatory method to detect the virus present in a lesion. In this, the genetic material of the virus is amplified. 
6. Biopsy
In case of a suspicion of cancer, a sample of skin tissue is taken for biopsy. ","Specialist To Visit

How to use it?
A cotton ball dipped in diluted apple cider vinegar can be used to apply it to the wart.Learn about the various benefits of apple cider vinegar.Click to Watch","Complications Of Warts
Approximately two-thirds of warts resolve on their own over several years. But some warts can lead to scarring as a result of topical treatment. Certain strains of HPV have been associated with the development of cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, anal cancer, and, rarely, cancer of the penis. It is usually seen in genital warts. Occasionally, the occurrence of warts on the vaginal wall may pose a challenge to the vaginal elasticity required for childbirth. In these instances, a cesarean delivery may be advised.","Alternative Therapies For Warts
Some alternative therapies might be effective in tacking warts. Do consult your doctor before initiating any of these:
1. Podophyllin resin
It is the extract that is derived from the roots of May apple plant. The topical application of this extract is known to treat genital and plantar warts. It works by inhibiting the growth and multiplication of viruses. Podofilox is another less irritating form of podophyllin available in the market. 
2. Duct tape therapy
In this, the duct tape is applied to the wart. This creates an environment that helps in the detachment of warts. 
3. Hypnosis
In this, the brain is controlled through various activities. It is used to treat unresponsive warts. The hypnosis can be induced through various ways such as the application of an imaginary freezing agent to the wart. The success rate is reported from 27-55% in children.
4. Hyperthermia 
In this, the affected part is immersed in the surface of hot water for 30-45 minutes. This should be done 2-3 times per week.","Living With Warts
Living with warts can be bothersome due to their chronic nature. It is essential to understand that most warts resolve on their own. The following measures help in faster recovery and reduce transmission. 
1. Keep the warts covered
Keeping warts covered helps prevent the transmission of warts to other body parts and other people. 
2. Wash your hands after touching the wart
When it comes to warts, maintaining good personal hygiene is not just a suggestion, it's a necessity. Every time you handle a wart, whether it's for dressing or any other reason, it's crucial to wash your hands thoroughly. 
3. Avoid shaving over a wart
Shaving over a wart can create microtears, which, in turn, increases the spread of warts. To avoid this, it's advisable to refrain from shaving over a wart. By being cautious and aware of such potential harm, you can better manage and prevent the spread of warts. 
Preventing the transmission
The virus of warts spreads very fast from one person to another. The significant complications develop due to the intra-transfer of the virus from one body part to another. These transmissions can be minimized through a more conscious approach. The following measures may help prevent transmission:

Avoid touching the wart
Use a waterproof plaster to cover the warts while swimming
Avoid sharing towels, shoes, gloves, and socks
Keep washing your hands frequently, especially after touching the wart 
Avoid scratching or picking at warts
Wear flip-flops or pool shoes in public showers, locker rooms, and pool areas

","Causes Of Whooping Cough
Whooping cough is a bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis & hence, also known as “pertussis”. It is a highly infectious disease that can be transmitted from one person to another through close contact. If a person suffering from whooping cough sneezes or coughs, the bacteria laden droplets get sprayed into the air, which when inhaled by a healthy person can enter their body. Once inside the body, the bacteria attaches to cilia (hair like extensions) that are present in the upper respiratory system. Post attachment, the bacteria releases toxins which damages the cilia and causes the airway to swell and discomfort in breathing.On an average, infected people are most contagious for upto 2 weeks after the cough begins. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), there are about 20-40 million cases of whooping cough globally. Of the total cases, 95% have been found to be diagnosed in developing countries.High incidence rates have been observed in young children due to low vaccination coverage. Coughing adults and adolescents are the major reservoir of B. pertussis and are the usual sources of infection in infants and children.","Symptoms Of Whooping Cough
The incubation period (the time period between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms of the disease) is 7-14 days.The symptoms can be divided into three stages:


The catarrhal phase


The paroxysmal stage


The convalescent phase


1. The catarrhal phase
This is  the most infectious period and lasts for 1-2 weeks.
The initial symptoms of whooping cough are mild and are similar to common cold which includes:


Mild cough


Nasal congestion


Sneezing


Runny nose


Low fever (below 102 degrees F)


The cough becomes more severe and frequent as the disease progresses. Though the cough may not be typically paroxysmal (sudden outbursts) in early stages, it tends to be annoying and more frequent at night.
2. Paroxysmal stage
This stage is characterized by paroxysms -- episodes of sudden outburst or bouts of cough. A thick layer of mucus accumulates inside the airways and causes uncontrollable coughing. Cough is marked by high pitched and long rasping indrawn breath at the end. This phase lasts for approximately 2-6 weeks.Prolonged and severe coughing may lead to:


Vomiting


Extreme fatigue


Red or blue face


High-pitched “whoop” sound with the subsequent breath of air


Not every whooping cough patient develops the characteristic “whoop” sound. In this case, persistent cough is considered a symptom for the disease. Intense coughing often results in loss of bladder control, heaviness in the head, headaches, vomiting, and exhaustion. Sudden but common triggers for the uncontrollable cough include yawning, stretching, laughing, yelling, or exercise. It may also occur more frequently at night.The longer it takes to treat the disease, the more frequent cough episodes may be experienced. Infants with whooping cough may not be able to cough and instead may find it very difficult to breathe.
3. Convalescent phase
The intensity and paroxysms of cough decrease gradually over 1-4 weeks. The vomiting becomes less frequent. Appetite, general condition and overall health usually improves.",,,,"Specialist To Visit
Symptoms of whooping cough mimic common cold and therefore diagnosis can often be difficult. However, persistent and prolonged cough can cause:


Vomiting after coughing


Turn your face or lips red, purple or blue


Difficulty in breathing


Whooping sound after the cough


Sluggishness


If symptoms of whooping cough do not resolve, and get worse you must book an appointment with your doctor to confirm the presence of the disease. To manage and treat the disease, you can consult the following specialists:


General physician


Pediatrician (in case of children)


Infectious disease specialist


Pulmonologist or a lung specialist


If your cough fails to subside or if you have any other symptoms along with cough, it is wise to book a consultation with our doctors. Consult Now!","Treatment Of Whooping Cough

Whooping cough is a bacterial infection and therefore can be treated with antibiotics. If the treatment of whooping cough is initiated at an early stage, it becomes easy to manage the severity of the symptoms. If your doctor confirms the presence of the infection, you will be recommended to start antibiotics right away. 
Medication
Commonly recommended antibiotics include:


Azithromycin 


Clarithromycin


Erythromycin


If an infant gets the infection, there is a higher chance of complication and risk. In most cases, infants may even need hospitalization. In a complicated and severe case, the patient may require intravenous fluids to replace the lost liquid levels. 
Supportive measures
General measures include providing adequate nutrition and hydration and avoiding factors aggravating cough. Nebulization with salbutamol is effective in reducing bronchospasm (tightening of the muscles that line the airways or bronchi in the lungs) and controlling bouts of cough. If nebulization is not possible, salbutamol may be given orally.","Home-care For Whooping Cough 
Common symptoms of whooping cough include cough, runny nose, fever and nasal congestion. Some home care tips and tricks for whooping cough include:


Do not give your child over the counter cough medications, unless prescribed by the doctor. 


Avoid contact with anyone in the household or outside till the time you don't recover completely from the infection. This will help prevent the spread. 


Flu-like symptoms can best be resolved with medications prescribed by the doctor and getting plenty of rest. Make sure you relax and take rest till the time your symptoms don't resolve completely. 


Keep your surroundings free from triggers such as smoke, dust and chemical fumes to avoid coughing and sneezing. 


Practice good hand hygiene by washing hands frequently and properly using soap. 


Drink plenty of fluids in the form of juices, water and soups to stay hydrated and avoid loss of water. Especially for children, be watchful for symptoms such as dry lips, lack of tears while crying and infrequent urination. 


Use of cool mist vaporizer that could help to loosen the mucus and soothe the lungs


Eat small meals in short intervals. This will help to digest the food and avoid chances of vomiting. 


Avoid close contact with others by keeping your mouth covered with a mask.

","Complications Of Whooping Cough

Whooping cough, if left untreated, can cause serious complications in different age groups, especially babies and young children. They are at a higher risk for complications because of not being vaccinated and protected. 

Infants: Complications of whooping cough
According to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), about half of the babies younger than 1 year old who get the whooping cough infection do need hospitalization. Of those babies who are treated in the hospital with whooping cough:


1 out of 4 (23%) get pneumonia (lung infection)


1 out of 100 (1.1%) will have convulsions (violent, uncontrolled shaking)


3 out of 5 (61%) will have apnea (slowed or stopped breathing)


1 out of 300 (0.3%) will have encephalopathy (disease of the brain)


1 out of 100 (1%) will die


Teens and adults: Complications of whooping cough
Teens and adults who are vaccinated tend to face less complications compared to those not vaccinated at all. Some of the commonly reported complications of whooping cough include:


Pneumonia: Lung health can be compromised and lead to pneumonia if whooping cough gets severe. Pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress and cause a medical emergency sometimes. 


Seizures: It is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain that causes changes in your behavior, movements or feelings, and in levels of consciousness.


Encephalopathy: It is a group of brain disorders that can be harmful if left untreated. 


Hernia: It is a condition when an area of an organ or tissue pushes through a weakened layer of muscle, usually in your groin or abdomen. Severe whooping cough can often lead to a hernia due to persistent and prolonged coughing. 


Damaged or collapsed lungs: Persistent coughing can cause pressure on the lungs and therefore can lead to collapsed lungs. 


Tuberculosis: It can lead to flare ups of tuberculosis infection. 


Malnutrition: This could be due to persistent vomiting and avoiding eating because of fear of cough.

","Living With Whooping Cough
Whooping cough is a bacterial disease and it can be cured with medications such as antibiotics. However, in some cases it can get severe and cause complications. Here are some tips to prevent and manage whooping cough effectively:


Stay up-to-date with your vaccination status: Vaccines for bacterial diseases such as whooping cough require booster doses after an interval of time. The immunity developed due to the dose tends to drop over the time. Therefore, make sure you get your booster dose as and when scheduled for. 


Get plenty of rest: Make sure you relax and take rest till the time your symptoms don't resolve completely. In case of complications, follow up with your doctor on a regular basis. 


Keep your surroundings free from triggers: Common triggers for cough include smoke, dust and chemical fumes. Make sure to keep your living surroundings clean and tidy. 


Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands frequently using soap to eliminate chances of a reinfection or spread of the disease. 


Keep yourself hydrated: Often bacterial infections can cause loss of fluids in the body. Drink plenty of fluids in the form of juices, water and soups to stay hydrated and avoid loss of water. 


Use mist vaporizers: If you experience discomfort due to the bacterial infection, use vaporizers that can help to loosen the mucus and soothe the lungs.


Eat small meals in short intervals: A bacterial infection can often cause difficulty in digesting food. It is recommended to consume small meals that are easy to digest in short intervals. Stay away from large meals. 


Avoid cough medications for children: It is highly recommended to avoid cough medications if your child is infected with the disease. They fail to clear the airway when used for children. 


Watch for signs of dehydration: Children with whooping cough may get dehydrated. Be watchful for signs of dehydration such as dry lips, and decreased frequency of urination.


In case of severity of infection, make sure to follow up with your doctor. Taking proper medications under the advice of your doctor will help manage the disease."

","Symptoms Of Wilson’s Disease 
 
Wilson's disease is present at birth, but signs and symptoms don't appear until the copper builds up in the brain, liver, or another organ. A few signs and symptoms depend on the parts of the body affected by the disease. These include

Liver symptoms 

In Wilson's disease, the majority of patient’s present with hepatic symptoms at diagnosis, and almost all have signs of liver damage over the course of the disease.In some cases, people develop these symptoms when they have acute liver failure. These symptoms may include:


Nausea and vomiting 


Poor appetite 


Darkened color of urine 


Yellowish tint to the whites of the eyes and skin, called jaundice


Pain in the upper part of the abdomen


In some people the symptoms of the disease develop in case of chronic liver disease and complications from cirrhosis. The clinical features of cirrhosis include spider naevi, splenomegaly, portal hypertension, and ascites.It has been recommended that all young patients with unexplained chronic liver disease, with or without cirrhosis, should be screened for Wilson’s disease if the following symptoms are visible in them: 


Swelling of the lower legs, ankles, or feet, called edema


Itchy skin


Jaundice


Feeling tired 


Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms
Neurological and neuropsychiatric signs are present in 40–50% of patients with Wilson’s disease. A few signs may appear before the characteristic neurological features, including changes in behavior, deterioration of school work, or an inability to carry out activities that need good hand-eye coordination. Common neurological symptoms may include:


Tremors (unintentional and uncontrollable rhythmic movement of one part or one limb of your body)


Lack of motor coordination


Drooling of saliva


Slurred or slow speech


Dystonia (contraction of muscles involuntarily, causing repetitive or twisting movements)


Headaches


Insomnia


Seizures


Mood disturbances 
Along with behavioral changes, other psychiatric manifestations include


Depression 


Anxiety


Hallucinations and delusions


Suicidal tendencies


Psychosis 
It is a severe mental disorder in which thought and emotions are impaired and contact is lost with external reality. Psychosis is majorly seen in patients with a neurological Wilson’s disease manifestation.

Eye symptoms 

The main ophthalmic findings of Wilson’s disease include:


K-F (Kayser-Fleischer rings) - usually greenish, gold, or brownish rings around the edge of the corneas


Sunflower cataracts  - brilliantly multicolored and are visible only by slit-lamp examination)


Other less common symptoms include


Night blindness


Exotropic strabismus - a form of eye misalignment in which one or both of the eyes turn outward


Optic neuritis - characterized by inflammation of the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain. This inflammation usually causes temporary vision loss.


Optic disc pallor - refers to an abnormal pale yellow coloration of the optic disc


Other changes 


Pathological changes of bone have been recorded to account for osteomalacia, osteoporosis, spontaneous fractures, adult rickets, and osteoarthritis.


Copper accumulation in heart tissues can cause cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias.


Other rare manifestations include hypoparathyroidism, infertility, repeated miscarriages, and kidney abnormalities. 

","Causes Of Wilson’s Disease 
Wilson's disease is caused by changes (mutations) in the ATP7B gene. This gene encodes a protein that plays an important role in the transport of copper from the liver to the rest of the body. Mutations in the ATP7B gene prevent this protein from working properly, which can lead to an accumulation of copper in the body. The ATP7B mutations that cause Wilson's disease are inherited, ie. they are passed from parent to child. These mutations are autosomal recessive,  meaning that a person must inherit two ATP7B genes with mutations, one from each parent, to have Wilson disease. People who have one ATP7B gene without a mutation and one ATP7B gene with a mutation do not have Wilson disease, but they are carriers of the disease. ","Risk Factors For Wilson's Disease
The risk of Wilson’s disease is genetic ie. it is inherited and the risk increases if your parents or siblings have the condition. A genetic test can be performed if a child shows symptoms of Wilson’s and has one or both parents who have the disease.","Prevention Of Wilson’s Disease 
Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder. People with a family history of Wilson’s disease should always go for genetic counseling as a part of pregnancy planning. Genetic counseling is a way to estimate personal genetic risk information and translate it into practical information for families. Genetic counseling helps families understand information about genetic disorders and explain the patterns of inheritance. Therefore, people will get a better insight into the future. ","Treatment Of Wilson’s Disease 
Successful treatment of Wilson’s disease depends upon timing more than medication. Treatment often happens in stages and should last a lifetime. If a person stops taking the required medications, copper can build back up again. Compliance is a problem for patients because they find it difficult to take life-long treatment when they feel healthy. The various treatment modalities are discussed in detail:
Chelating therapy 
The first treatment is to remove excess copper from the body through chelation. Penicillamine and trientine are chelating agents used to treat Wilson's disease. These medicines work by binding excess copper in body tissues, carrying it to the kidneys where it is finally removed via urine.


Penicillamine: Penicillamine is the most commonly used chelating medication but while taking this medication, it is advisable to have regular monitoring of full blood count and urinary protein because of possible adverse effects. The early side effects in the first 1–3 weeks include sensitivity reactions with fever, rash, swelling of lymph nodes, thrombocytopenia, and increased levels of protein in urine. These side effects of penicillamine can be severe, requiring discontinuation in many patients. 




Trientine hydrochloride: It is regarded as an accepted alternative to penicillamine for the initial treatment of Wilson’s disease. Trientine has few side effects and although they are similar to penicillamine, the frequency is much lower.


To maintain normal levels of copper after removal 
The second stage is to maintain normal levels of copper after removal. The doctor may prescribe zinc or ammonium tetrathiomolybdate as it prevents the intestines from absorbing copper. 


Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate: this medication forms a complex with copper and protein. When it is taken with meals, the drug forms complexes with copper in the food and that is secreted into the intestine, thus preventing absorption. 




Zinc acetate: Zinc was first used in the 1960s to treat Wilson’s disease. Its mode of action is through inhibition of copper absorption in the intestine. Zinc monotherapy appears to be effective and safe in neurologic Wilson’s disease and consequently may have a role as first-line therapy in this setting. 


NOTE: Penicillamine or trientine must not be taken at the same time as zinc because either drug can bind with zinc, forming a compound with no therapeutic effect.

Long-term maintenance therapy 

After the symptoms improve and the copper levels are normal, doctors usually focus on long-term maintenance therapy. This includes continuing zinc or chelating therapy and regularly monitoring your copper levels. Even avoiding foods having a high level of copper in them such as dried fruits, mushrooms, nuts, chocolate, shellfish, and multivitamin. 

Other therapeutic agents 

Toxic concentrations of copper in the liver produce oxidant damage to mitochondria with lipid peroxidation, which can be reduced experimentally by vitamin E administration. Vitamin E concentrations may be low in patients with Wilson’s disease.

Liver transplantation 

Liver transplantation may be lifesaving for patients with severe Wilson’s disease or severe hepatic insufficiency non responsive to drugs. Liver transplantation is a curative therapy, with neurologic and psychiatric disease stabilizing or improving, and Kayser-Fleischer rings disappearing over time.","Living With Wilson’s Disease 

Self-care
Self-care is an integral part of daily life. It means you take responsibility for your health and well-being, with support from people involved in your care. Self-care involves things to stay fit, maintain good mental and physical health and effectively deal with other minor ailments.

Low copper diet

Foods with a high concentration of copper generally should be avoided, at least in the first year of treatment when the excess copper is being cleared from the body. These include liver, cashews, black-eyed peas, vegetable juice, shellfish, mushrooms, chocolate and cocoa.

Regular follow-ups with doctors

Poor long-term adherence to drug therapy for Wilson’s disease is common. But, continual, lifelong treatment of Wilson disease is mandatory regardless of whether symptoms are present. Regular follow-up care with an expert in liver disease is highly recommended.","Complications Of Wilson’s Disease

Cirrhosis of liver 

Cirrhosis of the liver is one of the potential complications that may develop from Wilson's disease. As the patient's body attempts to clear the buildup of excess copper from the liver, scar tissue is formed in the area, compromising normal liver function. During the early stages of cirrhosis, patients may be asymptomatic, with symptoms appearing only in the most advanced stages. In the later stages, the symptoms of cirrhosis include jaundice, itchy skin, fatigue, swelling in the legs, and loss of appetite. For patients with Wilson's disease, liver abnormalities can begin as early as six years of age. 

Kidney stones 
Patients with Wilson's disease have an increased risk of developing kidney stones, which are formed from tiny deposits of the salts and minerals that are normally filtered by the kidneys.Due to their increased risk for kidney stones, it is recommended that patients with Wilson's disease have an annual x-ray to check for any stones. If small stones are found, these can often be passed with the help of pain relievers, alpha-blockers, and plenty of fluids. Larger stones may require other surgical interventions.

Hemolysis 
It is characterized by the abnormal destruction of red blood cells, and it is a potential complication for patients with Wilson's disease. This condition causes patients to feel fatigued, and they may also have an increased heart rate and an enlarged spleen or liver. Patients may feel weak, and they could become dizzy or confused.

Neurological issues 
Patients with Wilson's disease may experience a variety of neurological issues. For example, lack of coordination, gait abnormalities, tremors, and slurred speech could occur. Some individuals might experience involuntary muscle movements or twitching, and speech difficulties have been observed. For some patients, neurological issues could be accompanied by psychological changes such as depression, irritability, mood swings, and changes in personality. Bipolar disorder and episodes of psychosis may develop. ","Alternative Therapies For Wilson’s Disease 
All Wilson's disease patients need to take some type of medication therapy to remove excess dietary copper every day, for life. In some cases, Wilson’s disease patients may benefit from additional forms of therapy to help control emotional or physical symptoms or regain lost movement or speech. These other forms of therapy maybe

1. Physical therapy 

Physical therapy restores function for individuals who have neuromuscular or skeletal problems like arthritis, osteoporosis, joint and muscle pain, and coordination issues. The physical therapy will include


Exercise and programs to increase muscle function, coordination, balance, and endurance


Training in mobility, gait stability, posture, and positioning


2. Occupational therapy 
Occupational therapy assists individuals with adapting to their social and physical environment.Therapists help improve function through:


Activities that help in maintaining memory, orientation, and cognitive integration


Adaptive techniques or equipment to overcome physical disabilities


Education and training in areas such as dressing, bathing, eating, and grooming


3. Psychiatric Care 
People with Wilson’s disease may experience a range of psychological disorders over their lifetimes. Depression is the most common and may happen at a rate that’s more than double that of the general population. The feelings that the person experience are:


Persistent sad, anxious, or empty mood


Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness


Thoughts of death or suicide, or suicide attempts


Difficulty sleeping, early-morning awakening, or oversleeping


Difficulty in concentrating, remembering, or making decisions


If any of these are suspected, get in touch with your personal physician or mental health professional for an evaluation.",,

","Symptoms Of Xerophthalmia
The symptoms of xerophthalmia depend upon the severity of deficiency and age of the patient and gradually progresses through the following stages: 
Night blindness (impaired sensitivity of the eye to light)
This is the first sign of xerophthalmia in which the person is not able to see in dim light and may bump into objects and/or show reduced mobility.
Conjunctival xerosis
It is characterized by the dull, dry, thick, wrinkled appearance of the conjunctiva. It develops due to changes in mucin secretion that lubricates the conjunctiva. 
Bitot spots
It refers to whitish, foamy, opaque deposits on the conjunctiva. 
Corneal xerosis
Cornea appears dull, dry and hazy in appearance.
Corneal ulceration or Keratomalacia
Corneal xerosis often leads to ulcers and softening of the cornea. It can even perforate and destroy the cornea of the eyes..
Corneal scars
Scarring of the cornea is a late and severe symptom of xerophthalmia.
Xerophthalmic fundus
It refers to the structural changes in the fundus (the inside, back surface of the eye). ","Causes Of Xerophthalmia
Vitamin A is an essential nutrient and is responsible for the following central functions of the eyes: 

A form of vitamin A, called retinal, combines with a protein called opsin to form rhodopsin, an essential light absorbing molecule needed for vision in dim light and color sensitivity.
Vitamin A also plays an important role in maintaining a clear vision by supporting the functioning of the cornea which is the protective outer layer of the eye
Vitamin A helps to stimulate the lacrimal glands to produce moisture in the eyes and avoid issues like dry eyes.

The deficiency of Vitamin A is the main cause of xerophthalmia. The causes of the deficiency include:
A. Inadequate dietary intake of Vitamin A
 Low intake of dietary sources of Vitamin A can be attributed to:


Insufficient food supply


Chronic alcoholism


Highly selective eating


Difficulty in swallowing


Mental illness

Any patient who is experiencing visible symptoms such as dry eyes, must consult the doctor immediately. The diagnosis of xerophthalmia is done by an ophthalmologist, a physician specializing in diseases and surgery of the eye. If you are facing any eye-related problems, consult our medical professionals.Consult Now!",,"Home-care For Xerophthalmia

1. Consume Vitamin A rich food 

People should consume food rich in Vitamin in their diet such as: 


Carrots


Broccoli


Fish


Fortified cereals


Beef


Liver


Eggs


Chicken


Mangoes


Whole milk


Green leafy vegetables


2. Wear glasses
Wearing glasses is a good practice as it reduces the pressure from the eyes and is helpful for the people suffering from night blindness. It also helps the eyes to focus in a better way. 
3. Avoid looking directly in the dark
The people suffering from night blindness should avoid looking at the dark source directly as it may adversely affect the pupil (black center of the eye). 
4. Eyes exercises
Patients having xerophthalmia should keep their eyes in motion by looking in different directions, focusing at different points and blinking their eyes. It serves as an eye exercise and helps in the recovery of the eyes. 
5. Adaptation to darkness
The people who are at initial stage of xerophthalmia i.e night blindness should try to adapt to darkness by sitting in a dark room for 20-30 minutes daily. They should also wear a sleep mask while sleeping. This will make the eyes comfortable in darkness and also help to prevent severe eye disorders. 
6. Eye massage
Eye massage is a very powerful tool to improve the overall health of the eyes. It should be done only under the supervision of an expert as improper technique can damage the eye lens. To do eye massage:


Put slight pressure on both the eyes with the palms


Keep that pressure for around 5-10 seconds


Vision will turn white instead of black for a slight moment


When the black vision comes back, open the eyes


This will significantly improve vision in the dark


Regular eye massage can prevent night blindness to some extent

","Complications Of Xerophthalmia
Vitamin A deficiency can cause various complications due severe malnutrition. It also increases the chances of mucosal infections. Keratomalacia and night blindness can also be life threatening in children.

High doses of Vitamin A can treat early symptoms such as conjunctival xerosis and night blindness. Corneal xerosis may however sometimes lead to permanent vision loss. ",,

","Symptoms Of Xerostomia

Xerostomia is generally the symptom for many health conditions and a side-effect of certain medications. But it can present itself with other symptoms that include:


Changes in perceiving the tastes along with intolerance to spicy, salty, or sour foods or drinks


Burning sensation in the mouth in addition to sticky, dry, and rough tongue


Difficulty in chewing, swallowing, tasting, or speaking


Sore throat


Atrophic, cracked, or chapped lips besides peeling


Mouth ulcers or sores


Increased chances of infections in the mouth


Hoarseness of the voice


Bad breath or halitosis


Increased dental cavities or decay


Ineffectiveness to retain dental dentures or any other oral prosthesis

","Causes Of Xerostomia

Xerostomia is a condition when the salivary glands produce less saliva leading to dry mouth. Some of the common causes include the following:1. Medications: This is the most common cause of xerostomia. Many medications that are sold over-the-counter mention dry mouth as the side-effect. Some medicines that are known to cause xerostomia are:


Medications for anxiety and depression


Drugs like anticholinergics that are used in the treatment of urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder


Decongestants and antihistamines used in allergies and cold


Some pain medicines


Some drugs are used in the treatment of high blood pressure


Certain bronchodilators used to treat asthma


Some medicines used in treatment of diarrhea


Certain muscle relaxants


Medications for Parkinson's disease


Drugs used in chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer


2. Radiation therapy: Radiation treatments to the head and neck region for treatment of cancer can cause irreversible damage to the salivary glands. This can lead to a significant decrease in salivary production. 3. Dehydration: Dehydration occurs when the body loses a lot of fluids without getting replenished. This can happen during hot summer months or conditions like vomiting, diarrhea, fever, excessive sweating, blood loss, or burns. When the body is dehydrated, production of saliva is reduced leading to dry mouth.4. Mouth-breathing or snoring: Breathing through the mouth due to nasal congestion or snoring while sleeping causes saliva to evaporate. This leads to dryness in the mouth.5. Medical conditions: Xerostomia can be a sign of medical conditions like:


Sjogren’s disease (formerly known as Sjogren syndrome)


Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)


Poorly controlled diabetes


Uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure)


Anemia


Hypothyroidism


Sinusitis


Sleep apnea


Cystic fibrosis


Mumps 


Yeast infections


Rheumatoid arthritis


Systemic lupus erythematosus


Parkinson's disease


Alzheimer's disease


Hepatitis C


Lymphoma 


Chronic graft-versus-host disease seen in bone marrow transplant recipients


Salivary gland agenesis or aplasia


Stroke


6. Aging: People might experience xerostomia as they age. The factors contributing to it can be the use of certain medications, changes in the body's ability to process medication, inadequate or improper nutrition, or long-term health problems.7. Nerve damage: Any injury, infection, or surgery that causes damage to the nerves of the head or the neck region can result in xerostomia.8. Smoking and drinking: Alcohol acts as a diuretic, meaning, as the body breaks down alcohol, it removes the water from the blood through urine. Also, smoking reduces the salivary flow rate leading to dryness of the mouth or xerostomia.9. Use of recreational drugs: “Meth mouth” is a condition due to the use of methamphetamine that causes severe xerostomia and damage to teeth. Other drugs such as marijuana also can cause xerostomia.10. Stress and anxiety: Cortisol (also called the stress hormone) is produced in excess when a person is under stress or is anxious. Increased levels of cortisol in saliva can change the composition of the saliva causing the mouth to become dry.",,"Diagnosis Of Xerostomia

The diagnosis of xerostomia is based on detailed: 
Medical history 
Details about duration, frequency, and severity of dry mouth are documented. The history of dryness at other sites (eyes, nose, throat, skin & vagina) along with complete prescription drug history, health conditions, and any other symptoms along with it are obtained. 

Physical examination 

Major salivary glands are examined for the presence of any pain, firmness, or enlargement. The amount and quality of saliva coming from the ducts inside the mouth is assessed. 
Examination of the mouth


There may be very little or no pooled saliva on the floor of the mouth. The saliva may appear stringy, ropy, or foamy. 


The presence of dry, sticky or reddish oral mucosa is inspected. Occasionally, fungal or yeast infections will be present, appearing as removable white plaques on the inner mucosal surface of the mouth. 


Tongue may appear dry with decreased numbers of papillae.


The extent and pattern of dental decay is evaluated. Multiple dental caries, especially at the neck of the teeth or the tips of the teeth along with plaque accumulation, gum infections can be seen.


Several office tests and techniques can be utilized to detect the abnormal functioning of the salivary glands. These tests are as follows:
1. SialometryAlso known as salivary flow measurement, it is a simple test or procedure that measures the flow rate of saliva. In this test, collection devices are placed over the parotid gland or the submandibular/sublingual salivary gland at the opening of the duct, and saliva is stimulated with citric acid. The normal salivary flow rate for the parotid gland when it is not stimulated is 0.4 to 1.5 mL/min/gland. The normal flow rate for “resting” the whole saliva is 0.3 to 0.5 mL/min; for stimulated saliva, 1 to 2 mL/min. Values less than 0.1 mL/min are generally considered xerostomic.2. SaliograpyIt is an imaging technique that may be used to detect any masses or stones in the salivary gland. It involves the injection of radio-opaque dye into the salivary glands.3. Salivary scintigraphyIt can be useful in assessing salivary gland function. Technetium-99m sodium pertechnate is injected intravenously to ascertain the rate and density of uptake and the time of excretion in the mouth. 4. BiopsyMinor salivary gland biopsy is often used in the diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), HIV-salivary gland disease, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Biopsy of major salivary glands is an option when malignancy (cancer) is suspected.5. Blood testsIn addition to accessing the salivary glands, some blood tests may also help in detecting any underlying infection or disease. The tests are:


Complete blood count (CBC) 


Blood sugar tests


Electrolyte levels

","Prevention Of Xerostomia

Though xerostomia is quite common, it can often be prevented. Here are a few tips to prevent it:


Drink a minimum of 2L (i.e. 8 glasses of 250ml each) of water a day. 


Start using a humidifier in your home, especially in the bedroom.


Breathe through the nose rather than through the mouth.


Consult the physician before taking any over-the-counter medications such as antihistamines and decongestants.


Avoid caffeinated beverages, tobacco, and alcohol, all of which increase dryness in the mouth.


Do not consume any recreational drugs as they may cause severe xerostomia.


Try maintaining and monitoring blood sugar levels in case of diabetes.


Practice good oral hygiene practices.


Note: If someone has to undergo radiotherapy, surgical transfer of one submandibular salivary gland to the submental space (deep compartment of the head and neck that lies in the midline below the chin) shields the gland during radiation therapy. Studies confirm that there is no adverse effect on the function of the gland in this position.","Treatment Of Xerostomia

Xerostomia can be managed by several over-the-counter medications and products that aid in providing relief from the symptoms. These medications range from salivary substitutes and stimulants to products designed to minimize dental problems. They are as follows:

1. Saliva substitutes
These can be used as artificial saliva that help replace the lost moisture and lubricate the mouth. These substitutes are available commercially, but they can also be compounded. Artificial salivas do not stimulate salivary gland production but are designed to mimic natural saliva. Thus, they are considered as replacement therapy rather than a cure.These salivary substitutes are available commercially as solutions, sprays, gels, and lozenges. In general, they contain an agent to increase viscosity such as carboxymethylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose, minerals such as calcium and phosphate ions and fluoride, preservatives such as methylparaben or propylparaben, and flavoring and related agents.
2. Saliva stimulants
A recently developed product called natrol dry mouth relief, which has a patented pharmaceutical grade of anhydrous crystalline maltose (ACM) is used to stimulate saliva production. It has been used in a clinical study of patients with Sjogren's syndrome and ACM was shown to increase secretions. Natrol dry mouth relief is formulated as lozenges that can be dissolved in the mouth three times daily. As its effect is to stimulate salivary glands, it is not recommended for patients whose salivary gland function has been lost through radiation therapy. 
3. Medications
Pilocarpine: Pilocarpine is a muscarinic (M3) agonist which stimulates the secretion of saliva. It is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of xerostomia due to salivary gland hypofunction caused by Sjogren’s syndrome or by radiotherapy for cancer of the head and neck area. Cevimeline: Cevimeline is a cholinergic agonist with a high affinity towards the muscarinic M3 receptors located on lacrimal and salivary gland epithelium, leading to an increase in the secretions of the exocrine glands. It is used to relieve the symptoms of xerostomia in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome.Note: These prescription medications have to be avoided in patients having asthma &  glaucoma.
4. Other medications and preparations
The following medications are under clinical trial and the efficacy is yet to be determined.


Anethole trithione: This is a bile secretion-stimulating drug or cholagogue. It acts by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system and increases the secretion of acetylcholine, resulting in the stimulation of salivation.


Yohimbine: It is an alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist which indirectly results in an increase of cholinergic activity peripherally thus improving salivation.


Human interferon alfa (IFN-a): This drug is currently undergoing clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy of low-dose lozenges in the treatment of xerostomia in patients with Sjogren’s syndrome.

","Home-care For Xerostomia
Home remedies for xerostomia help in managing the symptom and provide relief however, these cannot be considered as the cure for it. 

1. Try over-the-counter saliva substitutes or oral lubricantsMany different brands of salivary substitutes or oral lubricants are available in the market. They do not cure xerostomia but provide some relief and help during eating and speaking.2. Drink a lot of waterSipping water and staying hydrated can help relieve the symptoms and discomfort caused by xerostomia. Studies have shown that dehydration may be a causative factor in xerostomia and increasing the water intake can help treat mild dehydration.3. Avoid certain medicationsThe most common cause for xerostomia is the use of certain medications. Talk to the doctor and understand if the medications are causing dryness in the mouth. Do not stop those medications abruptly without consulting the doctor. The types of medicines that may cause dry mouth include:


Antianxiety medicines


Anticonvulsants


Antidepressants


Antihistamines


Antipsychotics


Sedatives


Smoking-cessation agents


Urinary incontinence agents


Bronchodilators


Decongestants


Diuretics


High blood pressure medications


Muscle relaxants


Narcotic analgesics


Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs


Opioid analgesics


Parkinson’s disease medications


4. Say no to dehydrating habitsSome of the common ways to prevent dehydration & thereby xerostomia are: 


Quit smoking


Avoid caffeine


Limit alcohol use


Decrease sugar intake


5. Give importance to overall oral careXerostomia can be both a symptom and a cause of poor oral hygiene. Maintaining good oral hygiene plays a crucial role in the management of xerostomia. This includes frequent flossing, fluoride toothpaste use, and use of mouthwash.When choosing a mouthwash, make sure it doesn't contain any alcohol as alcohol-based mouthwashes will only further increase dryness of the mouth. Also, mouthwashes containing xylitol can also help prevent dental caries.Since dry mouth often leads to the development of fungal infections like oral candidiasis, antifungal mouth rinses, and dissolving tablets might be required. Dentures often lodge fungal infections, so they should be soaked daily in a chlorhexidine solution.6. Try sugarless candies or gumsSucking on sugar-free candies or products like chewing gums, cough drops, and lozenges may provide some short-term relief from xerostomia. Citrus, cinnamon or mint-flavored candies make good choices. Some sugarless gums and candies also contain xylitol which can help in prevention of dental cavities.7. Use lip balms frequently Moisturizing the lips with a lip balm or petroleum jelly every 2 hours can also be helpful.8. Dietary modifications
Moisten foods with gravy, soups, sauces, creams, ghee or butter. Also. taking sips of water or fluids while having a meal can help in softening the food and chewing. Try to have foods that are at room temperature.Restrict salty foods and dry foods like toast, cookies, dry breads, dry meats, dried fruits, and bananas. Foods and beverages with high sugar content should also be avoided.9. Avoid mouth breathing consciouslyMouth-breathing can make xerostomia worse and may also cause other oral health problems. 10. Use a humidifierCreating a humid environment may help in relieving xerostomia simply by adding more moisture to the surroundings.","Complications Of Xerostomia

Xerostomia can often be a contributing factor for both minor and serious health problems. It can affect nutrition and dental as well as psychological health. Some of the common problems associated with xerostomia include:


Constant sore throat


Burning sensation in the mouth 


Halitosis or bad breath


Difficulty speaking and swallowing


Hoarseness of voice


Dry nasal passages


Excessive plaque accumulation


Gum diseases


Dental caries


Oral candidiasis

","Alternative Therapies For Xerostomia

1. Home remediesHerbal medicines have shown potentially good results on improving salivary function and to reduce the severity of xerostomia. Moreover, they are relatively safe. Some of the herbs that can be used to manage xerostomia are:


Aloe vera: The gel or juice inside the aloe vera plant is very moisturizing. Drinking aloe vera juice can be a treat to the mouth and provide relief from xerostomia.




Ginger: Ginger is known to help stimulate salivary production.


Homemade mouthwash: Blend 1 cup of warm water with 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon of salt. Rinse your mouth for a few seconds then rinse with water. Repeat every 3 to 4 hours.


2. Oil pullingOil pulling is an old age ayurvedic technique of holding a few tablespoons of coconut or sesame oil in the mouth for 10 to 15 minutes without swallowing. Since the oil cleans out the mouth while coating and soothing irritated spots, it can give some relief in xerostomia.3. Unani therapyAccording to Unani therapies, the best way to manage xerostomia is through lifestyle modifications. This is based on Setteh-e-Zarurieah, which means consuming foods that are moisturizing in nature like rice cooked with milk, fresh fish, goat meat, foods that are prepared with pumpkin and spinach as well as purslane.The best food for patients with xerostomia are almonds, figs, grapes, peaches, and fresh broad beans. 4. AcupunctureIn acupuncture, an acupuncturist inserts thin, disposable needles into the skin in such a way that energy flow increases to the mouth and throat. However, acupuncture as a therapy needs more studies and scientific backing.","Living With Xerostomia
Xerostomia is a condition that causes dryness of the mouth. It can be mild or severe depending on the cause. Xerostomia can be treated with salivary substitutes, salivary stimulants, and meditations.In addition to these, the symptoms of xerostomia can be managed by following certain simple tips. They are as follows:

The yellow fever virus is an arbovirus of the flavivirus genus and is transmitted by mosquitoes, belonging to the Aedes and Haemogogus species. Different mosquito species live in different habitat: some lives in the wild, some are domestic and some in both habitat. There are 3 types of transmission cycles:


Sylvatic (or jungle) yellow fever: In tropical rainforests, monkeys, which are the primary reservoir of yellow fever, are bitten by wild mosquitoes of the Aedes and Haemogogus species, they pass the virus on to other monkeys. The humans traveling in the forest are bitten by infected mosquitoes and later develop yellow fever.


Intermediate yellow fever: During this type of transmission, semi-domestic mosquitoes (those that breed both in the wild and around households) infect both monkeys and people. Increased contact between people and infected mosquitoes leads to increased transmission. This is the most common type of outbreak in Africa.


Urban yellow fever: Large epidemics occur when infected people introduce the virus into heavily populated areas with a high density of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and where most people have little or no immunity, due to lack of vaccination or prior exposure to yellow fever.

",,"Diagnosis Of Yellow Fever 
Yellow fever is difficult to diagnose, especially during its early stages. A more severe case can be confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, other hemorrhagic fevers, and infection with other flaviviruses (such as dengue hemorrhagic fever). 

1. History and physical examination 
The diagnosis requires a thorough travel history and record of immunization. The doctor may evaluate the present symptoms such as headache, malaise, jaundice, and myalgias with severe back pain. The incubation period of the virus is usually 3-7 days, with most individuals having a mild flu-like illness. In severe 15% of cases, symptoms include chills, low back pain, headache, and fever. During the physical examination, the doctor may check the Faget sign or pulse fever dissociation, facial flushing, and conjunctival injection. During the most toxic phase, patients develop jaundice, dark urine, and vomiting. Bleeding may occur from mucous membranes and in the gastrointestinal tract.

2. Lab tests 
Laboratory confirmation is important after the physical evaluation is done by the doctor. 


Antigen detection: Rapid detection methods include the detection of yellow fever antigen using a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay in serum specimens.It is accomplished by testing serum to detect virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies. 


Polymerase chain reaction: This improved technique not only ensures the specific detection of a wide range of yellow fever virus genotypes but also may increase the sensitivity of detection. 


Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): This is a common test that is able to detect different types of antibodies produced at different stages of the infection. This test  uses the binding of antibodies to antigens to identify and measure certain substances. 


3. Other tests 


Lumbar puncture: In case of altered mentation, a lumbar puncture is performed. A lumbar puncture is sometimes called a cerebrospinal tap a medical procedure that can involve collecting a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 


Computed tomography (CT) scan: A CT scan uses computers and rotating X-ray machines to create cross-sectional images of the body. In case the brain is involved in yellow fever, a CT scan is performed. 


Liver function tests (LFT): If the liver is involved, the coagulation profile may be abnormal. 


Chest X-ray: A chest x-ray is done in patients with respiratory distress because of pulmonary edema.


Electrocardiograph (ECG): This test is performed in case of prolonged QT and PR intervals. Arrhythmias are common when the myocardium is affected.


Complete blood count (CBC): The blood test may also show a reduction in the number of infection-fighting white blood cells (leucopenia). This can occur because the yellow fever virus affects bone marrow (the spongy material at the center of some bones that produces blood cells).

","Prevention Of Yellow Fever 
The most effective way to prevent infection from yellow fever virus is to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquitoes bite during the day and night. 

Vector control

This can be done by using insect repellants, wearing long sleeves shirts and pants, stopping mosquito breeding both indoors and outdoors by avoiding water lodging, and preventing mosquito bites while traveling overseas.Have you tried these latest range of mosquito repellants like mosquito repellent bands, patches and more? If not, have a look!Check Out!
Vaccination 
Yellow fever can be prevented by taking vaccination against it. A single injection of yellow fever vaccine given subcutaneously provides immunity to 100% of its recipients. The vaccine provides immunity only after 10 days of vaccination. However, a booster dose is required every ten years by persons residing in nonendemic countries. A further dose of vaccine is recommended for a small number of travelers who are visiting yellow fever risk areas, including those who were previously vaccinated when they were:


Pregnant


Under 2 years old


Living with HIV


Had a weakened immune system


There are some groups of people who cannot have the yellow fever vaccine when it's recommended include: 


People whose immune system is weakened by treatment, such as steroids and chemotherapy


People who had a severe reaction to a previous dose of yellow fever vaccine


People with a thymus gland disorder or who've had their thymus gland removed


Epidemic preparedness and response
Prompt detection of yellow fever and rapid response through emergency vaccination campaigns are essential for controlling outbreaks. A confirmed case of yellow fever in an unvaccinated population is considered an outbreak. A confirmed case in any context must be fully investigated. ","Home-care For Yellow Fever 
No specific treatment exists for yellow fever, which is one reason that preventative measures such as vaccination are so important. Supportive treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and includes rest, fluids, and the use of medicines to help relieve fever and aching.There is no specific home care treatment for yellow fever. The patient requires care and time to time medicines and few precautions. Home care is to be taken to make the disease tolerable:


Get plenty of rest


A sponge bath can reduce discomfort due to fever


Drink plenty of water 


Pain relievers and analgesics such as acetaminophen


To reduce itching from the rash, one can use witch hazel on the rashes or add oatmeal to a bath


Talking with a doctor openly in case of any questions related to the disease 


Taking adequate sleep


Dietary modifications


Drink a minimum of 8 glasses of water daily.


Avoid refined foods, such as white bread, pasta, and sugar.


Use healthy oils in cooking, such as olive oil, coconut oil, or ghee.


Reduce or eliminate trans fats found in processed and packaged foods like biscuits, namkeens, and cakes.


Limit caffeine-containing beverages like coffee. Avoid alcohol and tobacco.

","Alternative Therapies For Yellow Fever 

Home remedies 

The following home remedies can help in recovery from yellow fever:


Garlic (Lehsun): It is known for its anti-inflammatory property; and thus, very good medicine for a mosquito bite.




Tomato (Tamatar): They have a good source of water content and thus provide enough water to the body. It helps in getting relief in nausea or vomiting caused due to yellow fever.


Coconut water (Nariyal pani): It is the best supplement for yellow fever, as it has the ability to turn yellow eyes to normal.


Watermelon (Tarbuz): It has cooling properties, a great substitute for water loss in the body due to nausea or vomiting or appetite loss that appears during yellow fever. 


Bitter gourd (Karela): It is the best method for reducing inflammation. It is advisable to drink at least two tablespoons of bitter gourd juice, twice a day.

Rash
Conjunctivitis
Muscle pain
Joint pain
Malaise
Headache

Patients might also experience some other symptoms such as: 

Abdominal pain
Diarrhoea
Constipation
Photophobia
Small ulcers on the oral mucosa

","Causes Of Zika Virus Disease
Most people get the Zika infection through mosquito bites. It is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito. These mosquitoes lay eggs & breed in or near stagnant water. Standing water in coolers, buckets, flower vases, and pots provide breeding sites to these infected mosquitoes. A person can get the virus in his blood through the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus usually remains in the blood for one week. These mosquitoes mostly bite during the morning and early afternoon. The basic reproduction number (R0, a measure of transmissibility) of Zika virus has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 6.6. R0 tells you the average number of people who will contract a contagious disease from one person with that disease. For example, if a disease has an R0 of 18, a person who has the disease will transmit it to an average of 18 other people.Note: R0 (R naught) is the basic reproduction number, also known as basic reproduction ratio or rate, which is used to measure the transmissibility of infectious agents.The other ways through which people can get the infection include:


Through unprotected sexual intercourse


Through contaminated blood transfusions


From mother to child

The factors that increase the risk of Zika virus disease include: 


Unprotected sex


Travelling to the areas where there are Zika outbreaks


Staying in Zika-infected area


Blood transfusion

","Diagnosis Of Zika Virus Disease

Zika virus disease is usually advised to be diagnosed within a week of developing symptoms or in case you or your partner have recently travelled to a contaminated area. The most common testing methods includes: 1. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): This method detects RNA (genetic material) of the Zika virus. It is a rapid, sensitive and specific method for early detection. The test can be done with urine, saliva & blood samples. Studies suggest that the genetic material of the Zika virus can be detected for a longer time in the urine and saliva of patients for a longer duration as compared to blood. This test can detect the virus during the first 3 to 5 days from the onset of infection. 2. Serology: It detects the antibodies such as immunoglobulin M (IgM) in the blood produced by the virus. The method can detect the presence of antibodies after 4 days of illness. IgM levels are variable, but generally become positive starting in the first week after onset of symptoms and continuing for up to 12 weeks post symptom onset or exposure, but may persist for months to years. Generally, it is not used much as it cannot differentiate with other flaviviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever.3. Plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT): These are quantitative assays that measure virus-specific neutralising antibody titers. PRNTs can resolve false-positive IgM antibody results that cause non specific infections and help identify the exact virus that has caused the infection. Thus, it is a confirmatory diagnostic method.

Examination during pregnancy

During pregnancy, several tests can be done to identify congenital Zika virus infection. These include:


Ultrasound: For Zika infected (or suspected) pregnant women, serial ultrasounds (every 3 to 4 weeks) are recommended. The test can detect various brain related abnormalities of the foetus such as microcephaly and intracranial calcifications. Microcephaly can be detected in the late second & early third trimester of pregnancy. Early detection (18 to 20 weeks of gestation) is also possible. 




Amniocentesis: In this procedure, amniotic fluid (fluid that surrounds the foetus) is tested for the possible Zika virus infection of the baby. It is done after 15 weeks of gestation as early detection increases the chances of infection. 


Several tests such as anemia, diabetes, hepatitis B and C, and HIV conducted during pregnancy can minimise or prevent various health threats. Read to know about some of the basic tests and their importance conducted during pregnancy.Click To Read!","Specialist To Visit
In most cases, the symptoms of Zika infection are usually mild and often go away on their own. However, visiting a doctor and early intervention may lead to slow progression and early resolution of disease. The specialists who can help treat this infection include:

In case of pregnancy, women should visit her obstetrician-gynaecologist as the Zika infection is known to cause several complications in the foetus. If you are facing any discomfort, seek advice from our world-class medical professionals. Consult Now!","Home-care For Zika Virus Disease
Once you have Zika virus, there are very few chances that you will experience any symptom. Symptoms are usually mild and rarely require hospitalisation. Try to take plenty of water and proper rest. Abstain from any kind of sexual activity as it may transmits the infection to your partner. Do not plan to conceive for at least 2 to 3 months after the recovery. Control mosquitoes both inside and outside your home. Pregnant women should regularly meet their gynaecologist to screen any foetal abnormality or birth defects. If you are taking care of a Zika infected patient, follow these precautionary measures to reduce the transmission. 


Do not touch blood or body fluids such as urine and vomit of infected person.


Wash hands properly after meeting the infected person.

",,"Complications Of Zika Virus Disease

People suffering from Zika virus disease usually recover on their own. The disease is mild and rarely requires hospitalisation. But, in some cases, the diseases can cause several complications. Pregnant women are at high risk of developing complications. 

Congenital Zika syndrome
There is a strong link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy & birth defects in children. An infected pregnant woman can pass the virus to her developing baby. It can cause a group of birth defects in the child known as congenital Zika syndrome. It can affect the growth & development of the developing baby. The possible abnormalities include: 


Smaller brains and collapsed skull, the condition is known as microcephaly


Decreased brain tissue


Scarring at the back of eye


Reduced mobility of the joints


Reduced movement of the body immediately after the birth


Epilepsy


Intellectual disability


Respiratory infection


Dysphagia


Neural tube defects


Cerebral palsy


Low birth weight


Vision problems



Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)
Zika virus disease can cause GBS, which is a neurological disorder in which nerve cells are damaged by the immune system. It can lead to muscle weakness. In advanced stages, muscles that control breathing can also be affected. Usually, patients recover from GBS within several months. Rarely, it causes permanent damage. GBS is a rare complication of Zika virus infection. It occurs in 2-3 patients out of 10,000 affected with the infection. 

Other neurological disorders

Zika virus disease can also lead to some central nervous system related disorders such as: 

Encephalitis
Meningoencephalitis
Retinopathies 
Neuropathy
Myelitis

Thrombocytopenia
Very rarely, Zika virus disease can cause thrombocytopenia. People with this disorder have less number of platelets which can result in bleeding, bruising and slow blood clotting.Here’s more about thrombocytopenia or low platelet count.Click To Read!

",,"Causes Of Zinc Deficiency
 
Zinc deficiency is mostly seen in developing and underdeveloped countries due to malnutrition. However, cases are also seen in developed countries as a result of various chronic illnesses. Zinc deficiency can be acquired or congenital.
Acquired zinc deficiency
The main causes of acquired zinc deficiency can be: 


Decreased intake of zinc


Decreased absorption of zinc


Increased demand of zinc


Excessive loss of zinc


1. Decreased intake of zinc
Inadequate intake of zinc is mostly related to:

Low intake of zinc rich foods
Strict vegetarian diets
Parenteral nutrition
Anorexia nervosa (eating disorder)

Vegetarians mostly have low levels of zinc because the body has the tendency to extract zinc from meat more efficiently. Eldery people also suffer from zinc deficiency because of limited access to certain foods. 2. Decreased absorption of zinc
A person may also have zinc deficiency even if he/she is taking adequate amounts of zinc. This can be due to the excessive consumption of certain food items or medications which can hinder the absorptions of zinc, and presence of certain disorders. These include:

Phytates containing foods such as legumes, seeds, soy products, and whole grains
Oxalates containing foods such as spinach, okra, nuts, and tea
Calcium and phosphates containing foods such as dairy, nuts and seeds
Medications such as thiazide diuretics (chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide), sodium valproate, antibiotics, and penicillamine

Diseases such as Crohn’s disease, short bowel syndrome, hookworm infestation and pancreatic insufficiency

3. Increased demand of zinc
The demand of zinc increases during pregnancy and lactation as it is required in the growth and development of the baby. The demands of the body increases as below:


Pregnant women (18 years of age and younger): 12 mg per day


Pregnant women (19 years of age and older): 11 mg per day


Breastfeeding women (18 years of age and younger): 13 mg per day


Breastfeeding women (19 years of age and older): 12 mg per day


Zinc, if not taken in adequate amounts during pregnancy and breastfeeding, can cause certain fetal defects and low birth weight.Are you eating the right type of food during pregnancy? Read in detail about various foods that should be eaten and avoided for a healthy pregnancy. Tap To Read!
4. Increased loss of zinc
In some cases, there can be excessive loss of zinc from the body which can also be a cause of zinc deficiency. This includes:


Dialysis


Hemodialysis


Hemolysis


Diarrhea 


Urinary loss (due to diuretics or alcohol use)


Congenital zinc deficiency 
Although zinc deficiency is commonly caused by dietary factors, several inherited conditions have also been found. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is one of the common inherited condition seen in humans. Acrodermatitis enteropathica: It is a rare form of zinc deficiency.which causes impaired absorption of zinc. It occurs in both congenital and acquired forms. The congenital form results from intestinal disorders due to genetic abnormality, whereas the acquired forms can result due to: 


Lack of secretion of zinc in the breast milk


After surgery of intestine


Adopting special intravenous nutritional programs 

",,,"Prevention Of Zinc Deficiency
Zinc deficiency can be easily prevented by taking the recommended amount of zinc either through dietary sources or supplements. 


Oysters contain the maximum amount of zinc per serving compared to any other food. 


Beef, red meat, poultry, and certain types of seafood (such as crab and lobster) also have a good amount of zinc.


Many grains, plants and dairy based foods are also good sources of zinc. These include  oats, legumes, chickpeas, beans, cashews, almonds, peas, chia seeds, and pumpkin seeds.


Note: However, some food items such as whole-grain breads, cereals, legumes contain phytates, which inhibit the absorption of zinc. Thus, the amount of zinc absorbed from grains and plant based foods is lower than that from animal based foods.The best way to prevent zinc deficiency is to add foods that are rich in zinc. Here are some common and naturally available food items and their zinc content.Click To Read!","Treatment Of Zinc Deficiency
Patients suffering from zinc deficiency can manage it by increasing the intake of zinc through diet. If dietary modifications fail to show any improvement in your condition, your doctor might recommend supplementation.  
1. Supplementation
The treatment of zinc deficiency usually begins with oral supplementation which has proven to reduce the symptoms. The recommended daily intake of zinc is:


3 mg/day for children less than 4 years


5 mg/day for children between 4 to 8 years


8 mg/day for children between 9 to13 years

11 mg/day for men

9 mg/day for women (non-pregnant and non-lactating)

11 to 12 mg/day for pregnant women 

Higher doses of zinc (more than 50 mg/kg) is required in patients who have severe deficiency. It is mostly needed in patients having chronic illnesses such as Crohn's disease and short bowel syndrome. High levels of zinc can interfere with copper and iron metabolism, so it is important to monitor the levels of zinc regularly in the patients taking zinc supplements. Supplements are taken for a lifetime in a condition called acrodermatitis enteropathica. Zinc supplements are available in the form of:


Zinc sulfate


Zinc acetate


Zinc aspartate


Zinc orotate


Zinc gluconate


Parenteral zinc supplementation is recommended in rare cases such as intestinal failure or if the patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
Interactions of zinc supplementation with medications
Zinc supplements can interact with several types of medications. Patients on zinc supplementation should discuss the intake of these medications with their health-care provider for dose adjustment. 


Antibiotics: Antibiotics such as quinolone & tetracycline antibiotics inhibit the absorption of zinc. It is advised to take these antibiotics at least 2 hours before or 4–6 hours after taking a zinc supplement to minimize this interaction. 

Penicillamine: Penicillamine is a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It also reduces the absorption of zinc. Patients should take zinc supplements at least 2 hours before or after taking penicillamine to reduce the interaction. 

Diuretics: Some diuretics such as chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide increase urinary zinc excretion. Prolonged use of these diuretics may affect the zinc levels adversely. So, the zinc status should be carefully monitored in patients who are on diuretics. 

","Complications Of Zinc Deficiency
1. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD): AMD is an eye disorder that causes vision loss. Studies suggest that zinc supplements help in the slow progression of AMD. 2. Growth failure: Since zinc is required for normal growth and development of the child, a low level of zinc for a long period of time can hamper its overall growth and development. 3. Skin problems: Skin complications associated with zinc deficiency include acrodermatitis enteropathica, cheilitis, and dermatitis.4. Diabetes mellitus and obesity: A prolonged and severe zinc deficiency is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and obesity. The exact mechanism behind this correlation is not known. 5. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Zinc deficiency in children can cause ADHD in children. ADHD is accompanied by lack of activity and impaired socialization in children. Read more about other causes, symptoms and management of ADHD.Other complications associated with zinc deficiency are:


Delayed wound healing


Recurrent infections such as pneumonia and malaria


Low bone mineral density


Hypogonadism


Herpes simplex virus infections


Wilson’s disease


HIV infection


Acne


Diarrhea


Zinc has antioxidant properties which protect from free radicals. Low levels of zinc also increases the risk of cancers and heart disease. Note: Maternal zinc deficiency during pregnancy can cause abortion, preterm bith, still birth and fetal neural tube defects. Babies born to such mothers have low birth weight.
Is there any relation between zinc deficiency and COVID-19?
Zinc also possesses antiviral and antiinflammatory properties. Deficiency of zinc may reduce the immunity (the ability of the body to fight infections). People with low levels of zinc are more prone to coronavirus infection. Zinc supplementation is hence used as an adjuvant therapy in faster recovery, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 because of its following potential benefits. Zinc helps by:


Restricting the entry of virus in the body


Inhibiting multiplication of the virus


Modulating immune response

It is also a source of zinc along with other micronutrients such as copper, sodium, iron, and potassium. 
Homeopathy
Several homeopathic medications such as Zincum aceticum and Zincum metallicum are also available for zinc deficiency. ","Living With Zinc Deficiency
Zinc deficiency can be easily reversed through proper supplementation and diet. You can keep the following points in mind while managing zinc deficiency.
Cook your food wisely
Changing the way of cooking certain foods can increase the absorption of zinc. For example soaking beans before cooking or leavening foods can lower the phytates concentration, making it easier for the body to process zinc. 
Consult a doctor 
A person having zinc deficiency can have other nutritional deficiencies. Consult your doctor as soon as you notice any other symptoms of nutritional deficiencies. 
Be cautious of toxicity
Overdose of zinc supplements can also cause toxicity and lead to symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. To avoid this, zinc supplements should always be taken as per your doctor's recommendation. The dose of zinc varies as per your age and other conditions such as pregnancy and breastfeeding. The patients who are on zinc supplements should get their zinc level tested every three months.
Do not self medicate
Before taking any zinc supplement, talk to your doctors as the dose varies as per your medical condition. The dose also varies, if you are on some other medications. 
Avoid certain foods
The foods that are high in calcium and phosphorus such as milk, cheese, yogurt, dried beans, lentils, and nuts delay the absorption of zinc. So, avoid taking zinc supplements with such food items. 
Be aware of allergy
Some patients taking zinc supplements can have allergy reactions which can be experienced as: 


Hives


Difficulty in breathing


Swelling of face, lips, tongue, and throat


Upset stomach


Consult your doctor immediately, if you have any of these symptoms. 
Manage the interactions with medications
Certain medications such as antibiotics, penicillamine, and chlorthalidone can reduce the absorption of zinc in the body. It is very important to discuss all the dietary supplements and medications you are already taking before initiating zinc therapy. "
